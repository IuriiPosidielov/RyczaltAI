VAT Law – Intracommunity Goods Movement Exemptions (Poland)

This article defines specific circumstances under which the movement of goods by a VAT taxpayer or on their behalf does not constitute an intra-community acquisition of goods, as per Article 11(1). It outlines nine exceptions, including:

1. Installation or mounting of goods (with or without test operation) delivered within the country, where the taxpayer delivers or arranges delivery.
2. Movement within intra-community distance sales.
3. Transport of goods on passenger-carrying vessels, aircraft, or trains under Article 22(5), for onward delivery by or on behalf of the taxpayer.
4. Goods destined for export-like operations conducted by the taxpayer within a Member State, then moved into the country.
5. Goods destined for intra-community supply operations under Article 13(1) and (2), performed by the taxpayer within a Member State and moved into the country.
6. Goods subject to services (valuation or work) performed within the country, to be returned to the originating Member State after service completion.
7. Temporary use of goods within the country by the taxpayer with a business establishment in the Member State of origin.
8. Temporary use of goods within the country for up to 24 months, provided import from a third country would be duty-free under temporary import rules.
9. Movement of gas, electricity, or thermal/cooling energy via distribution networks.

If any of these conditions cease to apply, the movement shall be treated as an intra-community acquisition.
