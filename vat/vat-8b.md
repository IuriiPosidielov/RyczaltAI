Taxation of Goods and Services in Exchange for Non-Specific Vouchers — Polish Tax Code Article 8b

1. The actual delivery of goods or actual provision of services in exchange for a non-specific voucher accepted by the supplier or service provider as payment or part of payment is subject to taxation. The earlier transfer of such a voucher is not subject to taxation.

2. If the transfer of the non-specific voucher is performed by a taxpayer other than the taxpayer performing the taxable activity under paragraph 1, then the intermediary services and other identifiable services—such as distribution or promotional services—related to that voucher are subject to taxation.

Taxation applies to transactions involving non-specific vouchers when they constitute payment or part-payment for goods/services, and intermediary services tied to such vouchers are taxable when transferred by a third-party taxpayer.
