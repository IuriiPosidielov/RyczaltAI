VAT E-Documentation Obligations for Cross-Border Sellers Using Electronic Interfaces — EU VAT Directive 282/2011

This article establishes that VAT-registered persons facilitating cross-border sales or services via electronic interfaces within the EU are required to maintain electronic records of such transactions. The obligations apply specifically to:

- Sales of imported goods (excluding those covered under Article 7a(1));
- Intra-community distance sales or deliveries to non-VAT registered recipients (excluding those covered under Article 7a(2));
- Provision of services to non-VAT registered recipients, where the service provider acts on their own behalf under Article 9a of Regulation 282/2011.

These records must comply with the requirements of Article 54c(2) of Regulation 282/2011, ensuring traceability for VAT reconciliation purposes. Records must be made available electronically to tax authorities within 14 days of a request, covering:

- Goods deliveries where shipment or transport begins or ends within the member state;
- Services performed within the member state.

In cases of technical failure, records must be provided in an alternative manner as specified by the tax authority within 14 days of a formal notice. Electronic copies of requests or notices may be sent to the taxpayer’s email address as specified in their special procedure declaration (Articles 6a, 7, 9, etc.), or otherwise provided by the taxpayer, or to the address listed on the taxpayer’s official website if no other address is provided.

Records must be retained for 10 years from the end of the tax year in which the transaction occurred.
