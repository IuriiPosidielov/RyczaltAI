VAT Declaration Obligations for Non-EU Entities – Poland’s VAT Code

Foreign entities identified for the purpose of non-EU procedures are required to submit VAT declarations electronically to the competent tax office, regardless of whether services covered by the non-EU procedure were provided. Declarations must be submitted quarterly, by the end of the month following each quarter. If the deadline falls on a Saturday or a statutory holiday, it is extended to the next working day. Declarations must include: (1) the identification number under Article 132(5); (2) for each consumption country: total service value net of VAT, total VAT due broken down by applicable VAT rates, and applicable rates; (3) for all consumption countries: total VAT due. Corrections for errors in submitted declarations must be made in the next VAT return, no later than within 3 years from the deadline for the original declaration, and must specify the correct consumption country, reporting period, and VAT amount being corrected. All amounts are expressed in euros. For payments made in currencies other than euros, conversion to euros uses the ECB exchange rate published on the last day of the reporting period; if no rate is published, the next day’s rate applies. VAT payments must be made in euros within the deadline, referencing the relevant VAT declaration, to the competent tax office’s bank account.

Foreign entities must submit VAT declarations electronically and remit VAT payments in euros to the competent tax office within the prescribed quarterly deadlines, using official exchange rates for foreign currency conversions and allowing for statutory holiday extensions.
