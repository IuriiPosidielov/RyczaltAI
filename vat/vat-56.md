**Customs Duty Exemptions for Personal Baggage Imports – Legal Framework (Article 56)**

This article establishes customs duty exemptions for personal baggage imports by travelers arriving from third-country territories, with specific thresholds based on value and nature of goods. Exemptions apply to non-commercial imports, subject to monetary limits: 300 EUR (approx. 300 PLN) for land/air/maritime travel, and 430 EUR (approx. 430 PLN) for air and maritime travelers. Goods exceeding these limits are exempted proportionally based on individual item values, unless divided — which is prohibited under this article.

Personal baggage includes all items a traveler can present to customs upon arrival, plus baggage later presented with proof of prior registration as checked luggage. Fuel in standard vehicle tanks and up to 10 liters in portable containers are included; other fuels are excluded. “Non-commercial import” means occasional, personal-use or gift-oriented goods only.

Additional exemptions apply to alcohol and tobacco products, with differentiated allowances based on traveler age (17+), mode of transport (air/maritime vs. other), and employment status (e.g., border-zone workers or transport crew). Specific quantities are permitted for spirits, wine, beer, cigarettes, cigars, and tobacco — with varying allowances depending on transport mode and traveler category.

Alcohol and tobacco exemptions may be combined proportionally, up to 100% of total value, but are excluded from the general value thresholds. Items such as fuel, personal baggage, and necessary medicines are excluded from the value calculations.

The provisions also apply to travelers transiting through third countries or starting journeys from EU territories without proof of EU purchase or VAT refund eligibility — except for non-stop flights.
