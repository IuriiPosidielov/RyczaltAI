VAT Simplified Procedure – Recordkeeping Obligations for Second and Last VAT Taxpayers (Poland)

This article outlines recordkeeping requirements for VAT taxpayers participating in the simplified VAT procedure under Article 15, specifically detailing mandatory disclosures for second- and last-in-line VAT taxpayers. The second taxpayer must report the agreed-upon compensation for deliveries under the simplified procedure and the name and address of the last taxpayer (which may be a non-VAT taxpayer legally required to settle VAT for the transaction). The last taxpayer must report turnover (excluding VAT) and the VAT due on deliveries within the EU, as well as the name and address of the second taxpayer. Additional provisions address situations where the second taxpayer is a non-EU VAT-registered entity, exempting recordkeeping obligations if delivery ends within Poland, provided all conditions in Article 136 are met for transferring VAT liability. The article also mandates reporting of transactions in VAT returns and summary reports for second taxpayers who are VAT-registered under Article 15.
