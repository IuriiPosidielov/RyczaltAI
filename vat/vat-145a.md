Tax Law – Polish VAT Registration & Fiscal Cash Register Regulation (Art. 145a–145a.17)

This article establishes legal requirements for taxpayers using fiscal cash registers with electronic or paper-based record-keeping in Poland, including mandatory registration, data integrity obligations, technical compliance, service provider responsibilities, and enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance. It defines procedures for obtaining and maintaining fiscal register numbers, mandates secure data transmission for electronic registers, requires printed copies for paper-based systems, prohibits memory card replacement in paper systems, and sets technical certification standards through the President of the National Institute of Metrology. Penalties are imposed for non-compliance with technical standards or failure to undergo mandatory technical inspections. The Minister of Finance and Minister of Economy jointly determine technical specifications, certification procedures, inspection timelines, and service provider obligations. The Minister of Finance may grant temporary exemptions for certain taxpayers or activities, balancing public interest, budgetary considerations, and compliance feasibility.
