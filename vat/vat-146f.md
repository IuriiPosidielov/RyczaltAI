Tax Law – Polish Tax Code – Article 146f – Debt-to-GDP Threshold Adjustments for Tax Rates

This provision establishes conditional adjustments to various Polish tax rates (including VAT, withholding tax, and refund rates) based on whether the public debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 55% as published by the Minister of Finance on or before specified deadlines. The thresholds trigger different tax rate schedules for defined periods, starting from July 1, 2012, and extending through 2017, with rates varying depending on whether the debt ratio exceeds 55% as of December 31, 2011 or 2012.

- If debt/GDP > 55% as of Dec 31, 2011: Tax rates are adjusted for:
  - 2012–2013 & 2015: 24% (Art. 41, 109, 110), 9% (Art. 41, 120, Annex 3), 6% (Art. 41, Annex 10), 5% (Art. 114), 7.5% (Art. 115).
  - 2013–2014: Rates increase to 25%, 10%, 7%, 6%, 8%.
  - 2016: Rates adjusted to 23%, 8%, 4%, 7% (for applicable taxes).

- If debt/GDP > 55% as of Dec 31, 2012: Applies similar rate schedules as above, but shifted forward:
  - 2013–2014 & 2016: Applies 2012–2013 rate schedule.
  - 2014–2015: Applies 2013–2014 schedule.
  - 2017: Applies 2016 rate schedule.

- If debt/GDP ≤ 55% as of Dec 31, 2012: No rate increases apply under this clause.

Polish tax rates are conditionally adjusted based on public debt-to-GDP ratios published by the Ministry of Finance, triggering tiered rate schedules from 2012 to 2017 under specific fiscal thresholds.
