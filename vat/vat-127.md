Tax Refund Eligibility for Sellers – Polish Tax Law (Art. 127)

This article establishes the conditions under which sellers may qualify for tax refunds on goods purchased by travelers under the TAX FREE system. To be eligible, sellers must be registered VAT taxpayers, maintain sales records using cash registers, have entered into refund agreements with entities referenced in Art. 126(8), and operate under the TAX FREE system. The requirement to have such agreements does not apply if the seller refunds a traveler directly. Sellers whose sales are exempt from VAT under Art. 113(1,9) or Art. 113a(1) are ineligible. Obligations include registering on the Electronic Services Platform for TAX FREE, providing written refund information in four languages (Polish, English, German, Russian), and clearly marking sales points for refund-eligible goods.

Refunds are paid in Polish zloty by the seller or authorized refund entities, either in cash or via non-cash settlement as defined in the Banking Act. Refunds may only be processed for goods purchased from the same seller. Non-seller entities may also process refunds if they meet strict criteria: at least 12 months of VAT registration prior to applying for a certificate (Art. 126(1)), formal notification to the tax office of their refund activity, no overdue social security or tax payments exceeding 3% of owed amounts in any category for at least 12 months, and posting a 5 million zł guarantee (cash deposit, bank guarantee, or Polish government bonds with at least 3-year maturity). The guarantee remains valid throughout the entity’s refund-related operations and is refundable upon cessation. Only limited liability companies or joint-stock companies may act as refund agents. Directors must not have prior convictions for tax crimes or profit-driven offenses. The refund certificate issued by the Chief of the National Tax Administration is valid for up to two years. The 3% payment threshold may be considered satisfied if overdue payments (with interest) were settled within 30 days of accrual. These rules also apply to entities reapplying for certificates, requiring compliance with the 3% threshold from the date of the previous certificate to the date of reapplication.
