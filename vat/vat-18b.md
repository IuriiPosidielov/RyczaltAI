Tax Representative Qualification and Appointment – Polish Tax Code Article 18b

This provision defines the eligibility criteria and procedural requirements for designating a tax representative under Polish tax law. It specifies that a tax representative may be an individual, legal entity, or organizational unit without legal personality, provided it meets conditions including: (1) having a business establishment within Poland; (2) being registered as an active VAT taxpayer (or EU VAT taxpayer under Article 18d(1)); (3) not having outstanding tax arrears exceeding 3% of due liabilities in each relevant tax for the past 24 months; (4) no criminal convictions under the 1999 Tax Criminal Code for tax offenses; and (5) being authorized to provide tax advisory services or accounting services under applicable regulations. 

The arrears condition may be satisfied if the taxpayer fully settled arrears (with interest) within 30 days of occurrence, and such settlements did not exceed two tax periods per tax type in the past 24 months. Article 18b(3) excludes customs agencies from the advisory authorization requirement under specific import/export conditions. Appointment must be formalized in writing, including names, addresses, identification data, documentation storage address, declaration of compliance with Article 18b(1), scope of authority (if under Article 18c(1)(2)), and consent to act on behalf of the taxpayer (if under Article 18d(1)).

Tax representative eligibility, appointment requirements, VAT compliance, arrears thresholds, criminal record checks, advisory authorization, customs agency exceptions, and contractual formalities — all governed under Polish tax law Article 18b.
