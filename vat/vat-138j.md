Customs and Tax Law – Article 138j: Procedures for Correcting Incorrect Tax Amounts Collected at the Border

When a customs authority determines that the person responsible for collecting tax has calculated and collected tax in an incorrect amount, the head of the customs and tax office issues a decision specifying the difference between the correct tax amount and the amount collected. The person for whom the goods were intended is liable to pay the tax. 

If it is found that the tax was collected in an incorrect amount, the head of the customs and tax office imposes an additional tax liability equal to 20% of the tax underpayment, provided the person responsible for collection knew or had reasonable grounds to suspect that the tax amount should have been different, based on accompanying documentation. This does not apply to individuals who are jointly liable for a tax offense or criminal tax violation. 

The head of the customs and tax office does not impose such additional liability if the person responsible for collection had verifiable information confirming that the value of the imported goods matched the value stated in the accompanying documentation. 

The person for whom the goods are intended may also request a decision from the head of the customs and tax office regarding the difference between the correct and collected tax amount. 

In cases covered by paragraphs 1 and 4, the provisions of Articles 33(6), 34(3–5), 37, and 38(2) apply accordingly. 

For proceedings regarding additional tax liability under paragraph 2: (1) Article 33(6) applies accordingly; (2) the Tax Ordinance applies.
