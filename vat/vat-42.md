**VAT Intracommunity Goods Supply – Taxation Rules (Poland)**

This article establishes the conditions under which intracommunity goods deliveries are subject to 0% VAT in Poland, provided the supplier meets specific documentation, registration, and cross-border delivery requirements. The supplier must verify the recipient’s valid VAT identification number, retain proof of goods leaving Polish territory and reaching a recipient in another EU Member State, and be registered as a VAT taxpayer in the EU. The 0% rate does not apply if the supplier fails to comply with reporting obligations under Article 100 or submits inaccurate summary declarations without proper justification. The delivery conditions may be waived in limited cases under Articles 13 and 16. Valid proof includes transport documents, cargo manifests, or, in cases of self-transport, a special “export document” detailing parties, goods, transport details, and the recipient’s acceptance. For new vehicles exported by the recipient, a specific export document must be issued, including a declaration of export within 14 days and notification of consequences for non-compliance. If the recipient fails to export within 14 days, VAT becomes due on the first day after the deadline. In cases where documents are insufficient, supplementary evidence (e.g., commercial correspondence, payment receipts, or acceptance proof) may be accepted. If proof of delivery is missing at the time of filing, the delivery is reported at the domestic VAT rate for the next reporting period and can later be corrected if valid proof is provided. These rules apply to deliveries under Article 13, paragraph 3, and the Minister of Finance may define the format of the export document for new vehicles to ensure proper documentation, tax control, and cross-border information exchange.
