**Customs Law — Intracommunity Acquisition of Goods (EU VAT Framework)**

Art. 9.1 defines “intracommunity acquisition of goods” as the acquisition of ownership rights over goods that, following delivery, are dispatched or transported across the territory of a Member State other than the country where the delivery or transport originated — either to the buyer or on their behalf.

Art. 9.2 specifies that Art. 9.1 applies only if:  
(1) the buyer is either:  
a) a taxable person under Art. 15 or a VAT-registered taxpayer whose acquired goods serve their business activity; or  
b) a legal entity not qualifying as such under (a), subject to the exceptions in Art. 10;  
(2) the delivery is performed by a taxable person as defined in (1)(a).

Art. 9.3 extends the scope of Art. 9.1 to cases where:  
(1) the buyer is not the one specified in Art. 9.2(1);  
(2) the delivery is performed by a party not specified in Art. 9.2(2), provided the acquired goods are new means of transport.

This provision governs VAT treatment of goods moved within the EU under intra-community acquisition rules, ensuring proper tax attribution based on delivery and ownership dynamics.

— *Intracommunity acquisition rules under EU VAT law govern ownership transfer and tax liability upon cross-border delivery of goods, particularly for new transport equipment and business-use goods, with conditions tied to buyer and seller VAT status.*
