VAT Registration and Notification Obligations for EU VAT Taxpayers — Polish VAT Law (Art. 97)

This article establishes procedural requirements for entities obligated to register as EU VAT taxpayers under Articles 15 and 15a, including mandatory notification to the head of the tax office prior to first intra-EU supply or acquisition. Registration must be effected via the registration declaration specified in Article 96. The obligation extends to non-registered entities whose intra-EU acquisitions exceed the threshold defined in Article 10(1)(2), and to those intending to use the provisions of Article 10(6). It also applies to entities providing services under Article 100(1)(4) to VAT-registered taxpayers or non-taxpayers identified for VAT purposes, and to those acquiring services under Article 28b treated as import services. The obligation does not apply to taxpayers with a registered VAT representative under Article 18d(1). Upon receipt of notification, the tax office registers the entity as an EU VAT taxpayer and issues a confirmation. Registered entities must use their VAT identification number prefixed with "PL" when engaging in intra-EU transactions, including acquisitions, deliveries, service provision under Article 100(1)(4), acquisition of services under Article 28b, or intra-EU movements of goods under call-off stock procedures. Termination of qualifying activities requires written notification via updated registration declaration within 15 days, triggering removal from the EU VAT register. Failure to file VAT returns (Articles 99(1)-(3)) for three consecutive months or quarters without reporting taxable supplies, acquisitions, or imports entitles the tax office to remove the entity from the register and notify it. The same applies if the entity fails to submit summary reports under Article 100 for three consecutive months despite the obligation. Removal from the EU VAT register under Articles 96(6), (7), (7b–7bb), (8)–(9a) also results in removal from the EU VAT register, with corresponding application of Articles 96(8b) and (9g–9k). Tax authorities or designated entities may verify identification of a taxpayer or non-taxpayer for intra-EU transactions in other EU Member States upon written, fax, electronic, or telephonic request. The Finance Minister may designate a specific organizational unit to handle such verifications and to ensure procedural efficiency. The Minister may also designate a tax authority responsible for registering first intra-EU suppliers or acquirers and define its territorial scope to enhance data verification and inter-authority information exchange.
