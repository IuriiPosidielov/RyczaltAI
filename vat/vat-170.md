Customs Law – Import Regulations Post-2004 Enlargement of the European Union

This article establishes transitional rules for the customs treatment of goods moved into the member state’s territory before and after May 1, 2004, particularly concerning goods originating from the EU territory prior to enlargement or from new member states that joined under the Accession Treaty signed April 16, 2003 (excluding the territory of the country in question). It defines when import obligations arise for such goods under VAT and customs law, based on their customs treatment (e.g., active customs clearance, temporary storage, customs warehouse, transit), and clarifies that customs and VAT rules applicable at the time of assignment of customs status continue to apply until the status ends — unless the goods are later used or re-exported under specific conditions. Import is deemed to occur upon completion of customs status or entry into free circulation, with specific exceptions for goods transported outside the EU or returned to the original exporting country under defined conditions. For goods subject to transitional rules, import tax liability arises at the moment of customs status completion or entry into free circulation — unless otherwise specified, such as for transport equipment previously acquired or imported before May 1, 2004, under applicable VAT rules.
