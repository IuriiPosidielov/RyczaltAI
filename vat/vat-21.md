VAT Law – Small Taxpayer Accounting Method (Poland)

Small taxpayers may opt for a cash-based VAT accounting method under which the VAT liability arises:

1) On the date of receipt of full or partial payment — in cases of supply of goods or services to active VAT taxpayers registered under Art. 15;
2) On the date of receipt of full or partial payment, no later than 180 days from the date of delivery of goods or provision of services — for supplies to non-VAT registered entities, provided prior written notification is submitted to the head of the tax office at least one month before the applicable reporting period; this is referred to as the “cash method.” Partial payment triggers proportional VAT liability.

This cash method applies to transactions occurring during the period in which the taxpayer uses it.

A small taxpayer may withdraw from the cash method, but not before completing 12 months of application, following prior written notification to the head of the tax office within the last quarter of the relevant period.

The right to use the cash method is lost starting with the VAT return for the month following the quarter in which the taxpayer exceeds the threshold specified in Art. 2, paragraph 25.

The cash method does not override Art. 19a, paragraphs 1 and 2, and is not applicable to:

a) Supplies covered under Art. 8a, paragraphs 1 and 3;
b) Supplies under Art. 20, paragraphs 1–4;
c) Supplies under Art. 7a, paragraphs 1 and 2, made to or by a VAT facilitator.
