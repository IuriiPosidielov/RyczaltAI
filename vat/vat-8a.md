Tax Law — VAT Regulations — Transfer of Single-Purpose Vouchers

Article 8a. 1. The transfer of a single-purpose voucher by a taxpayer acting in its own name is treated as the delivery of goods or provision of services covered by that voucher.

2. The actual delivery of goods or actual provision of services, in exchange for a single-purpose voucher accepted by the supplier or service provider as payment or part of payment, is not treated as an independent transaction to the extent that payment was made in the form of the voucher.

3. If a taxpayer acting on behalf of another taxpayer transfers a single-purpose voucher, such transfer is treated as delivery of goods or provision of services covered by the voucher, performed by the taxpayer on behalf of whom the transfer was made.

4. Where the supplier of goods or service provider is not the taxpayer who issued the single-purpose voucher while acting in its own name, such supplier or service provider is treated as having delivered the goods or provided the services covered by the voucher to the taxpayer who issued the voucher.
