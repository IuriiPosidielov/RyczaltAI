VAT Simplified Procedure – Cross-Border Sales – Legal Framework for Taxation Attribution

In simplified VAT procedures, where the second-in-line taxpayer (as defined in Art. 135(1)(4)(b) and (c)) is also listed in Art. 15, the intra-EU acquisition is deemed taxed by that taxpayer if they issue a VAT invoice to the last-in-line taxpayer containing, in addition to the data specified in Art. 106e:

1. An annotation stating: “VAT: Simplified Intra-EU Invoice under Art. 135–138 of the VAT Act” or “VAT: Simplified Intra-EU Invoice under Article 141 of Directive 2006/112/EC”;  
2. A statement that the VAT due on the delivery will be settled by the last-in-line taxpayer;  
3. The identification number (Art. 97(10)) used by the issuer for VAT purposes with both the first and last-in-line taxpayers;  
4. The identification number of the last-in-line taxpayer for VAT purposes.

This rule applies accordingly if the last-in-line entity is a legal person not registered as a VAT taxpayer, but identified for intra-EU transactions in the Member State where the goods are located at the end of dispatch or transport.

It also applies if the last-in-line entity is either a VAT taxpayer under Art. 15 or a non-VAT taxpayer identified under Art. 97, and the second-in-line taxpayer is a VAT taxpayer under Art. 135(1)(4)(b) and (c) using a VAT identification number issued by a Member State other than Poland, in accordance with that Member State’s rules for documenting simplified procedures.
