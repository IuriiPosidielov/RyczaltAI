VAT Law – Article 13k: Timing of Goods Movement and Loss Conditions

1. If, within the time frame specified in Article 13i, any condition outlined in Article 13h(2) or Article 13j ceases to be met, the movement of goods referred to in Article 13(3) is deemed to have occurred at the moment that condition ceased.

2. If the right to dispose of goods as owner is transferred to a person other than the VAT taxpayer (or their substitute) who was intended to receive the goods, the conditions in Article 13h(2) or Article 13j are deemed to have ceased immediately before such transfer.

3. If goods are shipped or transported outside the territory of the member state or to a third country, the conditions in Article 13h(2) or Article 13j are deemed to have ceased immediately before the shipment or transport begins.

4. In cases of destruction, loss, or theft of goods moved into a call-off stock warehouse, the conditions in Article 13h(2) or Article 13j are deemed to have ceased on the day the goods were lost, stolen, or destroyed; if that date cannot be determined, then on the day their loss or destruction was discovered.
