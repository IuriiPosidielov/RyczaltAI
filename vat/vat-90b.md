**Vehicle Tax Adjustment Rules — Polish VAT/GST Context**

Art. 90b — Adjustment of tax amounts for vehicles based on change in usage during 60-month period following acquisition, import, or commissioning.

1. If, within 60 months from the month of acquisition, import, or commissioning of a vehicle:
   - (1) The vehicle, as defined in Art. 86a(3)(1)(a), is used for both business and non-business purposes, the taxpayer must adjust the previously deducted tax amount.
   - (2) The vehicle, for which the tax amount was based on Art. 86a(1), is exclusively used for business purposes, the taxpayer may adjust the previously deducted tax amount.

2. If the vehicle is sold during the adjustment period under paragraph 1, its usage is deemed changed to exclusive business use until the end of the adjustment period.

3. Paragraph 1(2) also applies to cases covered under Art. 86a(13).

4. For adjustment purposes, the vehicle is treated as no longer exclusively used for business or as exclusively used for business, starting from the month of usage change. Adjustments are made in the tax return for the period in which the change occurred, proportional to the remaining adjustment period.

5. If the vehicle is used in business activities including tax-exempt operations without deduction rights, the adjustment amount must reflect the proportion specified in Art. 90, applied during initial deduction.

6. For vehicles with initial value not exceeding 15,000 zł, adjustments under paragraph 1 apply if the usage change occurs within 12 months of acquisition, import, or commissioning. Paragraphs 2–5 apply accordingly.
