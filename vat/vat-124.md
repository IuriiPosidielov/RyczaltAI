Tax Relief for Taxpayers Engaged in Tax-Exempt Gold Activities – Polish Tax Code

This article grants taxpayers performing tax-exempt activities under Article 122(1) the right to reduce their tax liability by the amount of tax paid on: (1) acquisition of investment gold from taxpayers referenced in Article 123(1); (2) acquisition (including intra-community) or import of non-investment gold, if subsequently converted into investment gold by the taxpayer or on their behalf; (3) services modifying gold’s form, mass, or purity, including investment gold. Additionally, taxpayers exempt under Article 122(1) who produce or process gold into investment gold may deduct tax paid on related goods or services acquired (including intra-community or imported). Article 86(2) applies accordingly.

Tax relief for gold-related transactions under investment gold provisions — applicable to taxpayers engaged in exempt gold processing or conversion activities, with provisions for offsetting tax paid on related acquisitions or services, aligned with Article 86(2) of the Polish tax code.
