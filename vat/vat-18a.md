VAT Registration and Representative Obligations under EU VAT Rules

A taxpayer referred to in Article 15(1) who does not have a business establishment or fixed place of business within the territory of a Member State and is required to register as an active VAT taxpayer shall be obliged to appoint a tax representative.

A taxpayer having a business establishment or fixed place of business in a Member State other than the territory of the country may also appoint a tax representative.

The competent Minister of Public Finance may, by regulation, specify cases in which the obligation to appoint a tax representative does not apply, taking into account the need to ensure proper tax accounting for entities without a business establishment or fixed place of business within the territory of a Member State.
