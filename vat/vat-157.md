VAT Registration Status Determination under Transitional Provisions — Polish Tax Law

This provision establishes the automatic classification of taxpayers registered on the last day before the effective date of a new VAT regime (as referenced in Art. 176(2)) under the transitional law specified in Art. 9 of the VAT Act (referenced in Art. 175). It excludes taxpayers listed in Art. 5(2) of that same Act. Taxpayers who indicated in their registration application (Art. 9(1)) that they intend to file VAT returns are deemed “active VAT taxpayers”; all others are deemed “exempt VAT taxpayers,” without requiring confirmation from the head of the tax office, subject to Art. 157(2).

Art. 157(2) excludes this automatic classification in two cases: (1) if an applicant who indicated intent to file VAT returns fails to actually file such returns for 6 consecutive months or 2 consecutive quarters prior to the effective date of the new law; (2) for separate legal entities’ branches or subsidiaries that are treated as independent taxpayers under Art. 5(2) of the VAT Act.

This provision governs the automatic classification of VAT taxpayers under transitional registration rules, with distinctions between active and exempt status, and exceptions for non-compliance or separate legal entity branches — under Polish VAT law.
