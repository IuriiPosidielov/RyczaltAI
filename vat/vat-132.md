Taxation Law – Non-EU Service Provider Registration Procedure (Poland)

Foreign entities providing services within a EU member state may submit an identification declaration to indicate intent to use the non-EU procedure. This procedure applies to all services rendered on EU territory. In Poland, declarations must be submitted electronically to the appropriate head of the tax office. The declaration must include: the foreign entity’s name, address with postal code, email address, website, tax identification number (if issued in its home jurisdiction), and a statement confirming no registered business establishment or permanent place of business exists within the EU. Upon approval, the tax office assigns an identification number for VAT purposes. If eligibility criteria are not met, the tax office issues a rejection decision with appeal rights. Registered entities must notify the tax office electronically of: (1) data changes, (2) changes in activity causing loss of eligibility, or (3) cessation of services — no later than the 10th day of the following month. Identity registration may be revoked if: (1) services cease, (2) contact is lost for two years, (3) eligibility is no longer met, or (4) procedural compliance is systematically violated — with appeal rights. Notifications of revocation are also sent electronically.
