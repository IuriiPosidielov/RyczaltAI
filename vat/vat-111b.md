Polish Tax Law — Article 111b: Electronic Sales Recording via Cash Registers

For certain groups of taxpayers or types of transactions, the recording of sales referred to in Article 111, paragraph 1, may be conducted using cash registers in the form of software meeting the requirements set out in regulations issued under paragraph 2, point 2.

The provisions of Articles 111 and 111a apply accordingly to such cash registers.

The Minister of Finance may, by regulation, specify:  
   (1) which groups of taxpayers or types of transactions may use such cash registers;  
   (2) technical requirements for such cash registers, including their usage methods, how sales records are maintained, procedures for terminating their use upon cessation of business or cash register operation, methods for issuing documents from such cash registers, and special cases for issuing sales receipts to buyers — taking into account the need to prevent non-recording or improper recording of sales by taxpayers, ensure security of recorded data, and enable safe data transmission between cash registers and the Central Cash Register Repository;  
   (3) the buyer’s right to receive a receipt displaying the tax amount, and the ability to verify the accuracy of sales recording and obtain a receipt confirming the transaction;  
   (4) technically optimal solutions for such cash registers according to the type of sales.

Polish VAT law Article 111b permits electronic sales recording via compliant cash register software for specific taxpayers or transactions, with technical and procedural rules set by the Minister of Finance to ensure data integrity, tax compliance, and buyer rights — applicable under VAT and fiscal administration frameworks.
