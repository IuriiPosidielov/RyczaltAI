Tourism Services – Place of Performance (Poland)

For tourism services referred to in Art. 119(1), the place of service provision is the location where the service provider maintains their business establishment, subject to paragraphs 2 and 3.

If tourism services referred to in Art. 119(1) are provided from a fixed place of business located outside the service provider’s main business establishment, the place of service provision is that fixed place of business.

If the service provider does not maintain a business establishment or a fixed place of business as referred to in paragraph 2, the place of service provision for tourism services under Art. 119(1) is the location of their permanent residence or usual place of stay.

This provision defines the legal determination of service performance location for tourism services under Polish civil law, based on the provider’s business or residential location.
