Polish Tax Law – Commission Sales Transactions (Art. 171)

In commission agreements, where the principal (komitent) delivered goods to the commission agent (komisant) before May 1, 2004, and no tax obligation arose prior to that date, the tax liability and basis of taxation for such transactions shall be determined according to the provisions of the law referenced in Article 175.

In commission agreements, if the commission agent acquired goods or imported them before May 1, 2004, and subsequently delivers those goods to the principal after April 30, 2004, the agent may claim tax adjustment for the tax due on the acquisition of those goods for the month of May, provided that the principal had not previously settled that tax before May 1, 2004.

This provision governs tax treatment of commission transactions under Polish VAT law, particularly regarding timing of tax liability and adjustment rights for goods transferred across the May 1, 2004, threshold.
