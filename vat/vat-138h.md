Electronic Recordkeeping Obligations for Import Transactions — Tax Law, EU VAT Directive 282/2011

1. The taxpayer, or in the case of a taxpayer represented by an intermediary, the intermediary, is obligated to maintain electronic records of transactions subject to the import procedure, in accordance with the requirements set out in Article 63c(2) of Regulation 282/2011. Intermediaries must maintain separate records for each taxpayer they represent.

2. The records must be made available electronically upon request by the member state of identification and the member state of consumption. In the event of technical difficulties preventing electronic access, records must be provided in the manner and within the timeframe specified by the competent tax authority.

3. Records must be retained for 10 years from the end of the tax year in which imported goods were sold at a distance.

Rationale: This provision establishes electronic recordkeeping requirements for import transactions under EU VAT rules, assigning responsibility to taxpayers or their intermediaries, specifying access procedures for member states, and mandating a 10-year retention period for import-related sales records.
