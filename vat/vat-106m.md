Tax Law – Electronic Invoice Regulation (Poland)

Art. 106m, as amended and effective from February 1, 2026, establishes the requirements for ensuring the authenticity of origin, integrity of content, and readability of electronic invoices. For structured invoices, the National e-Invoice System (Krajowy System e-Faktur) guarantees these attributes. For non-structured invoices, taxpayers must define their own methods to ensure authenticity, integrity, and readability — including through business controls, qualified electronic signatures, EDI systems compliant with the European e-Data Exchange Model, or via the National e-Invoice System for structured invoices received through it.

Art. 106n requires the recipient’s acceptance of electronic invoices and mandates that common data for multiple invoices sent to the same recipient be provided only once, provided all such data are available for each invoice.
