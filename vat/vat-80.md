**Tax Exemptions for Diplomatic and Consular Personnel and Their Families – Polish Tax Code**

Art. 80. 1. Exemption from import tax applies to goods intended for use by:

1) Official foreign diplomatic missions, consular offices, and special missions located within the country’s territory, as well as international organizations with headquarters or offices in the country;

2) Diplomatic staff (including heads of diplomatic missions, diplomatic personnel, special mission personnel, and international organization personnel) accredited to Poland, along with their family members residing with them, provided they enjoy diplomatic privileges and immunities under Polish law, international treaties, or universally recognized customs;

3) Consular officers of foreign states and their family members residing with them;

4) Non-immune foreign staff members employed by diplomatic missions, consular offices, or special missions within the country — on a reciprocity basis and subject to the condition that the goods are not transferred to third parties for a period of 3 years from the date of their first commercial use by the aforementioned persons.

2. Reciprocity applies to motor vehicles (as defined in Art. 2(32) of the Road Traffic Act of June 20, 1997) under the same exemption conditions, provided the delay in compliance with Art. 80(1) was justified by circumstances related to the official duties of the individual — such as relocation of the vehicle for employment purposes in another country — and the individual has resided in the country for at least two years.

— Exemptions apply to diplomatic, consular, and international organization personnel and families under Polish import tax law, governed by reciprocity and specific eligibility conditions.
