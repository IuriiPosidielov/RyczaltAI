Call-off Stock Warehouse Procedure – VAT Treatment in EU Trade

This article defines the conditions under which movements of goods under the call-off stock warehouse procedure are not considered intra-community acquisitions under Article 11(1). It specifies four cumulative requirements: (1) goods must be shipped or transported by the VAT taxpayer or a third party acting on their behalf from one EU Member State to another for subsequent delivery to another VAT-registered EU taxpayer, who will have ownership rights as per prior agreement; (2) the sender must not have a business establishment or fixed place of business in the destination country; (3) the recipient must be a registered EU VAT taxpayer, with their name, personal details, and Polish VAT ID (preceded by “PL”) known to the sender at the time of dispatch; (4) the sender must record the movement in the VAT register under Article 54a(1) of Regulation 282/2011 and include the recipient’s VAT ID in the summary information under Article 100(1)(5).

Call-off stock warehouse movements under EU VAT rules are not treated as intra-community acquisitions, provided all four conditions are met, including recipient registration, sender’s absence of local business presence, and proper VAT record-keeping.
