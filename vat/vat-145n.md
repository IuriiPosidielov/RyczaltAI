VAT Law – Transitional Provisions on Structured Invoices (Poland)

From February 1, 2026, to December 31, 2026, taxpayers obligated to issue structured invoices may use:  
electronic invoices or paper invoices via cash registers, or fiscal receipts recognized as invoices under Art. 106e(5)(3).  

Sales values documented by electronic invoices or paper invoices via cash registers are excluded from total sales value and VAT amounts under Art. 87(6e)(1) and (2).  
Art. 106h(1) does not apply to such invoices or fiscal receipts.  
Electronic invoices or paper invoices via cash registers, where sales value and VAT are recorded in daily fiscal reports, are entered into the accounting records under Art. 109(3) in the reporting period of issuance. These invoices do not increase sales or VAT liability for the period in which they are recorded.
