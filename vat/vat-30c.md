Import VAT Exemption Rules for Services and Goods — EU Customs and VAT Coordination

The basis for VAT on imported services is not established when the service value has already been included in the VAT base for intra-EU acquisition of goods, or when, under separate provisions, the service value increases the customs value of imported goods.

The basis for VAT on goods delivery is not established where, under Art. 17(1)(5), the recipient is the VAT taxpayer, and VAT on goods installed or mounted on the country’s territory — with or without trial operation — has been fully collected at import from the acquiring taxpayer. However, if the import VAT amount is lower than the VAT due on domestic delivery, the acquiring taxpayer must settle the difference.
