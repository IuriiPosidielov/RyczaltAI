Tax Law – Polish VAT Regulations on Electronic and Paper-Based Cash Register Documentation (Art. 145b)

This provision outlines phased implementation deadlines for taxpayers using cash registers with electronic or paper-based recordkeeping for specific sales and service activities. The scope includes:

- Until December 31, 2019: Sales of motor vehicle and moped repair services (including tire services), and sales of gasoline, diesel fuel, and fuels for internal combustion engines.
- Until June 30, 2020: Services from stationary gastronomic establishments (including seasonal), short-term accommodation, and sales of coal, briquettes, and similar solid fuels for heating purposes.
- Until December 31, 2020: Services such as hairdressing, cosmetics, construction, medical care by physicians and dentists, legal services, and fitness facility access (limited to entry).
- Until December 31, 2021: Sales under the “travel VAT refund” system (as defined in Chapter XII, Section 6).

The rules apply only to cash registers used for recording sales or services listed above. Taxpayers may claim deductions or refunds under Article 111, paragraphs 4 and 5, for purchases of compliant cash registers, with eligibility dates aligned to each phase’s start date. Technical or organizational limitations may extend deadlines, and the Minister of Finance may issue regulations to further extend deadlines, considering industry specifics and audit feasibility.
