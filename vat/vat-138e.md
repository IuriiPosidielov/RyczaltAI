VAT Import Procedure – Registration, Representation, and Compliance Requirements (Polish Tax Law)

This article outlines the procedural and administrative requirements for taxpayers and intermediaries participating in the VAT import procedure under Polish tax law. It establishes the obligation to submit registration declarations, specifies the roles of intermediaries, sets conditions for changing the identifying member state, mandates electronic submission to Polish tax authorities, defines required data fields for declarations, and outlines notification and exclusion procedures for non-compliance or termination of participation.

Key elements include:
- Taxpayers must submit declarations to designate their identifying member state.
- Intermediaries act on behalf of taxpayers in specific cases.
- Taxpayers or intermediaries may not change their identifying member state before two full tax years have elapsed.
- Declarations must be submitted electronically to the competent tax office in Poland.
- Required information includes taxpayer/intermediary names, addresses, contact details, VAT identification numbers, and, for intermediaries, individual identification numbers.
- Tax authorities assign VAT identification numbers and individual intermediary IDs upon approval.
- Declarations must be updated promptly for changes in data or business scope.
- Non-compliance, cessation of activity, or failure to meet conditions may lead to rejection of applications or exclusion from the import procedure.
- All notifications, including denials and exclusions, are delivered electronically.
