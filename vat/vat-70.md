**Customs Duty Exemptions for Import of Trade and Exhibition Goods – Legal Provisions (Art. 70)**

This article establishes customs duty exemptions for specific import categories under Polish customs law, primarily for goods brought into the country for exhibition, promotional, or demonstration purposes at qualifying events. Exemptions apply under strict conditions and exclude alcohol, tobacco, and fuels.

Exempt imports include:
- Small, free samples of goods manufactured abroad, intended for promotional distribution, non-commercial use, and low unit value.
- Goods brought solely for demonstration of machinery and equipment from third countries, intended for consumption or destruction during the event.
- Low-value materials for booth construction, decoration, and display (e.g., paints, wallpapers) that will be consumed or destroyed.
- Printed promotional materials (catalogs, brochures, posters, calendars, photos) distributed free of charge for advertising goods from third countries.

These exemptions are available only for goods imported for specific types of events, including trade fairs, exhibitions, charity events, scientific/technical/artistic/educational/cultural/sporting/religious events, international organization meetings, and official commemorations.

Notably, non-processed food and beverage samples may also be exempt if consumed free of charge at qualifying events — but alcohol, tobacco, and fuels remain excluded from this exemption.

*This provision defines eligibility criteria for customs duty relief on exhibition and promotional imports under Polish customs law, excluding specific prohibited categories.*
