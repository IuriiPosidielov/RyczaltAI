Taxation of Mixed Sales: Method for Calculating Tax Liability for Small-Scale Retailers

This provision outlines the method by which taxpayers engaged in retail trade, who sell both taxable and exempt goods or goods taxed at different rates and are not required to maintain records under Article 111(1), may calculate their tax liability. They may allocate sales revenue during a tax period based on documented purchases made during the same period, using only goods intended for resale at prices inclusive of tax. For new or resumed business activities, the allocation may be based on documented purchase percentages from prior periods within the same tax period.
