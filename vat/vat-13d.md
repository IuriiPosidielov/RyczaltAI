VAT Law – Intracommunity Acquisition Timing Rules

This article establishes the conditions under which the moment of intracommunity acquisition of goods (as defined in Art. 11 para. 1) is deemed to have occurred, based on the cessation of specific conditions outlined in Art. 13a para. 2 or Art. 13c. It also addresses situations where ownership rights are transferred to a third party, goods are shipped or transported outside the originating Member State or to a third country, or goods are destroyed, lost, or stolen under a call-off stock procedure.

1. If, within the time frame specified in Art. 13b, any condition from Art. 13a para. 2 or Art. 13c ceases to be met, the acquisition is deemed to occur at the moment that condition ceased.

2. If ownership rights over goods are transferred to a person other than the taxpayer referred to in Art. 13a para. 2 point 3 or their successor, the conditions of Art. 13a para. 2 or Art. 13c are deemed to have ceased immediately before such transfer.

3. If goods are shipped or transported to the territory of a Member State other than the one from which they originated, or to a third country, the conditions of Art. 13a para. 2 or Art. 13c are deemed to have ceased immediately before the shipment or transport begins.

4. In cases of destruction, loss, or theft of goods stored under a call-off stock procedure, the conditions of Art. 13a para. 2 or Art. 13c are deemed to have ceased on the day of such event; if the exact date cannot be determined, the day of discovery of the damage or absence is used.

VAT intracommunity acquisition timing rules govern when goods are considered acquired within the EU for VAT purposes, based on cessation of ownership or movement conditions.
