Tax Law – Penalty Provisions for Underreporting or Overclaiming Tax Liabilities

This provision establishes procedures and penalties for taxpayers who, in their tax declarations, understate their tax liabilities, overclaim tax refunds, or improperly adjust future tax reductions. It applies when such errors are discovered during tax or customs-tax audits, and imposes additional tax obligations based on the severity of the error and the taxpayer’s corrective actions.

In cases where a taxpayer:  
- Submits a declaration with understated tax liabilities, overstated refunds, or inflated future tax reductions,  
- Or fails to submit a declaration and pay the owed tax,  
the head of the tax office or customs-tax office determines the correct amounts and imposes an additional tax liability of up to 30% of the understated amount, overstated refund, or inflated future reduction.

If the taxpayer corrects the error within the timeframe (e.g., by filing an amended declaration and paying the correct amount or refunding excess), the penalty is reduced to up to 20%.  
If the taxpayer files a declaration or amendment under Article 62(4) of the Act on the National Tax Administration and pays within the same timeframe, the penalty is further reduced to 15%.

When calculating the penalty, the authority considers:  
- Circumstances leading to the error,  
- Type and severity of the taxpayer’s breach,  
- History of previous non-compliance,  
- Amount of the understated tax or overstated refund,  
- Actions taken by the taxpayer to rectify the error.

This rule does not apply if:  
- The taxpayer corrected the error before the audit began (via amendment or correct declaration) and paid the correct amount with accrued interest,  
- The error resulted from accounting mistakes or obvious omissions (e.g., tax missed in one period but included in another),  
- The taxpayer is an individual who is already subject to criminal or administrative penalties for the same act.
