**Tax Law – Article 32: Adjustment of Tax Base Based on Related Party Transactions**

In cases where the buyer and the supplier of goods or services are related parties as defined in paragraph 2, and where the consideration paid is:  
1) below market value, and the buyer lacks full entitlement under Articles 86, 86a, 88, 90, and regulations issued under Article 92(3) to reduce the tax liability by the amount of tax already charged;  
2) below market value, and the supplier lacks full entitlement under Articles 86, 86a, 88, 90, and regulations issued under Article 92(3) to reduce the tax liability by the amount of tax already charged, and the supply is otherwise exempt from tax;  
3) above market value, and the supplier lacks full entitlement under Articles 86, 86a, 88, 90, and regulations issued under Article 92(3) to reduce the tax liability by the amount of tax already charged — the tax authority shall determine the tax base according to market value, if it appears that the related party relationships influenced the determination of the consideration for the supply of goods or services.

Related parties, as referred to in paragraph 1, include:  
1) relationships defined in Article 23m(1)(5) of the Personal Income Tax Act and Article 11a(1)(5) of the Corporate Income Tax Act;  
2) employment relationships;  
3) relationships arising from training or apprenticeship arrangements.

Paragraph 1 does not apply to transactions between related parties for which the competent tax authority has issued a prior pricing agreement under Chapter III of the Act of October 16, 2019, on resolving double taxation disputes and entering into prior pricing agreements (Journal of Laws 2023, item 948).

**Summary**: Tax base adjustment required for related-party transactions where market value deviates from consideration paid, unless prior pricing agreement exists.
