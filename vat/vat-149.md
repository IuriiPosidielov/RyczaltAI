Customs and VAT Law – Export Condition Compliance (Poland)

The export condition referred to in Article 6(8a)(1) of the law mentioned in Article 175 is deemed fulfilled if, no later than six months after receipt of the advance payment, one of the following occurs:  
1) The goods are exported to the territory of a Member State other than the country of the taxpayer, and the taxpayer possesses a document confirming that the buyer has accepted the goods on the territory of such Member State;  
2) The goods are exported in accordance with Article 2(8) of the law mentioned in Article 175.

In cases referred to in Articles 18(4)–(7) of the law mentioned in Article 175, receipt of a document confirming export of goods outside the country after April 30, 2004, entitles the taxpayer to adjust the VAT due on the sale, in the tax period in which the taxpayer received the document.

Export compliance under VAT law post-April 30, 2004, requires timely documentation of goods leaving the country, enabling VAT adjustments in the relevant tax period.
