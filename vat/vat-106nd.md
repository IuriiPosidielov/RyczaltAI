Tax Law / Electronic Invoicing System – Poland (Krajowy System e-Faktur)

The Head of the National Tax Administration (Szef Krajowej Administracji Skarbowej) oversees the National e-Invoicing System (Krajowy System e-Faktur), serving as its data administrator. The system enables: user authentication and permission verification; issuance, access, receipt, and storage of structured invoices; assignment of unique invoice identifiers; batch identifier allocation for multiple invoices; data analysis and validation; and automated notifications regarding invoice status, system unavailability, or permission changes. These functions apply to VAT invoices (both standard and correction invoices) issued via the system. The system also supports receipt of invoices under specific legal provisions (e.g., public procurement, OpenPEPPOL). In cases of system downtime or unavailability, taxpayers may issue invoices in electronic format using alternative methods, with mandatory re-submission to the system within 7 working days after restoration. The system also mandates specific digital identifiers and authentication codes for invoices issued outside the system, and defines rules for duplicate invoices, date recognition, and access rights for recipients under specific legal provisions.
