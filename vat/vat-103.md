Tax Compliance and Payment Obligations – Polish Tax Code (Art. 103)

This provision outlines mandatory tax calculation and payment deadlines for taxpayers and entities under Article 108, including special rules for monthly, quarterly, and intra-community transactions, as well as specific provisions for transport vehicles and excise goods. Obligations apply without requiring prior summons from the tax office head, with exceptions noted in subsections 1a–4 and Articles 33/33b. Monthly payments are due by the 25th of the following month; quarterly payments by the 25th of the month after the quarter ends. Special 14-day rules apply for certain intra-community acquisitions of transport vehicles or goods, with mandatory reporting to the tax office. Excise tax on specific fuel and petroleum products (listed by CN codes) must be paid within 5 days of entry into the customs territory or upon movement into the country, with rules adjusted for VAT invoice dates. The competent authority for excise tax matters is the tax office handling excise duties. The Ministry of Finance may issue regulations specifying transport vehicle reporting formats.
