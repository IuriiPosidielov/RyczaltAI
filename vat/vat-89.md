**Tax Refund Provisions for Non-Resident Entities, Diplomatic Missions, and EU Military Personnel — Polish VAT Law (Art. 89)**

This article establishes conditions under which non-resident entities, diplomatic missions, consular offices, military personnel of NATO and EU member states, and other internationally recognized persons may claim VAT refunds in Poland. It defines eligibility, procedural requirements, documentation standards, and administrative rules for refund claims, including electronic submission, proportional adjustments, interest on overdue refunds, and recovery of improperly obtained refunds.

Eligible entities include:  
- Diplomatic and consular representatives and their staff (non-Polish nationals without permanent residence);  
- NATO and EU military forces, civilian personnel accompanying them, and vendors supplying goods/services to these forces;  
- Non-resident entities without Polish business premises or habitual residence, not conducting sales within Poland;  
- Foreign taxpayers identified under special procedures in Chapter XII (sections 6a, 7, 9) without Polish business premises.

Refund eligibility is governed by provisions in paragraphs 1a–1g and regulations issued under Articles 2, 3, and 5. Paragraph 1a allows refunds for goods/services purchased or imported in Poland if used to perform VAT-deductible activities in another EU state. Paragraph 1b mandates proportional refund calculations when goods/services are partially used for deductible activities. Paragraph 1c excludes refunds for non-compliant invoices, transactions listed in Art. 2(8)(b) and Art. 13, or transactions where no refund is permitted under Art. 15.

Paragraph 1d prescribes submission methods: electronic for entities with foreign business addresses, paper via prescribed form for those without. Paragraph 1e requires post-submission corrections if the deductible proportion changes in the subsequent tax year, either via amended refund claim or by filing a new one if no new claim is submitted. Paragraph 1f mandates interest on unreturned refund amounts, while 1g requires repayment of erroneously received refunds with interest, with no further claims allowed for the remaining balance.

Paragraph 1h and 1k provide special procedures for VAT refund claims by taxpayers under Art. 15, including electronic submission to the relevant EU member state, with exceptions for non-eligible taxpayers (e.g., those only engaged in tax-exempt transactions). Paragraph 1j allows the tax office to issue a decision rejecting such transfers, with electronic notification to the taxpayer.

Paragraphs 2–3 delegate to the Minister of Finance (in coordination with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Ministry of National Defense) the authority to issue regulations specifying refund conditions for diplomatic missions, NATO/EU military entities, and their associated personnel and vendors. These regulations must consider international agreements, reciprocity, documentation requirements, and EU law.

Paragraph 5 mandates detailed regulations for refund procedures, including:  
- Conditions, deadlines, and payment of interest on unclaimed refunds;  
- Standard form for paper submissions (Art. 1d(2));  
- Required information and formatting in electronic claims;  
- Document requirements for specific cases;  
- Eligibility criteria for refunds under Art. 1;  
- Procedures for post-submission corrections (Art. 1e/1l);  
- Use of electronic communication and compliance with EU directives.

Paragraph 6–8 extend refund eligibility to humanitarian, charitable, and educational organizations (recognized under the 2003 Public Benefit Act) and their exports, with refund conditions determined via regulation considering economic conditions, budgetary needs, proper documentation, export tracking, and EU rules. Paragraph 8 also details the required information, formatting, and submission timelines for electronic refund claims under Art. 1h, including proof of VAT deductibility and eligibility.

**Summary**: This Polish VAT article governs refund eligibility and procedures for non-resident entities, diplomatic missions, NATO/EU military personnel, and public benefit organizations, specifying documentation, submission methods, proportional adjustments, interest on overdue refunds, and regulatory authority under EU and international frameworks.
