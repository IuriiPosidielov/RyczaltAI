Tax Law – VAT Exemption Withdrawal – Gold Transactions

Article 123. A taxpayer may withdraw from the exemption provided under Article 122, paragraph 1, if:

1) The taxpayer produces investment gold or processes other types of gold into investment gold, and the delivery is made to another taxpayer, or  
2) Within the scope of their business activity, the taxpayer delivers gold for industrial purposes, and the delivered gold is investment gold as defined in Article 121, paragraph 1, point 1, and is delivered to another taxpayer.

2) The provisions of paragraph 1 apply accordingly to services referred to in Article 122, paragraph 2.

3) Taxpayers referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 are required to notify in writing the head of the tax office of their intention to withdraw from the exemption, no later than the beginning of the month in which they withdraw, unless they are commencing the activities referred to in Article 122 within the current tax year—in which case, notification must be submitted before the first performance of such activities.

Taxpayers may withdraw from VAT exemptions related to investment gold transactions under specific conditions, with mandatory written notification to tax authorities prior to the effective withdrawal date.
