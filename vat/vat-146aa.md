Polish Tax Law – Temporary Tax Rate Provisions (2019–2022)

This provision establishes temporary tax rate reductions for specific fiscal years, contingent on meeting public finance thresholds under the Act of August 27, 2009, on Public Finance. Applicable from January 1, 2019, to the end of the following year, if:  
- The ratio defined in Article 38a(4) of the Public Finance Act does not exceed 43%, and  
- The value under Article 112aa(5) of the same Act is not less than -6%.

Under these conditions, the following tax rates apply:  
1. 23% rate (Articles 41(1,13), 109(2), 110, 138i(4))  
2. 8% rate (Articles 41(2), 120(2,3), and Annex 3 to the Act)  
3. 7% refundable tax rate (Article 115(2))  
4. 4% tax credit rate (Article 114(1))

Paragraph 1a extends these rates to the end of the year following the one in which the conditions are met again — provided:  
- Expenditure is calculated under Article 112aa(1) due to compliance with Article 112d(4), and  
- The same ratio and value thresholds are satisfied — but not beyond December 31, 2022.

Paragraphs 2 and 3 are repealed.

Summary: Temporary Polish tax rate reductions (2019–2022) tied to public finance thresholds under the Public Finance Act, with rates capped at 23%, 8%, 7%, and 4% — extendable until 2022 under continued compliance.
