Tax Exemption for Pharmaceutical Imports for International Sporting Events

Article 60 provides for exemption from import tax on pharmaceuticals and medicines intended for human or animal medical use, imported from third countries, specifically for participants in international sporting events held within the country’s territory — provided the quantity and type of goods are appropriate to the purpose of import and the duration of the sporting event.

Exemption applies to pharmaceutical imports for medical use, limited to international sporting events held domestically, contingent on quantity/type alignment with event purpose and duration.
