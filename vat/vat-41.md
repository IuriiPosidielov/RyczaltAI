**VAT Rate Framework – Polish Tax Law (Art. 41–16)**

This provision establishes the statutory VAT rates applicable in Poland, including general, reduced, and zero rates, with specific exemptions and transitional rules. The standard rate is 22%, subject to exceptions under Articles 83, 119(7), 120(2–3), 122, and 129(1). Reduced rates of 7% and 5% apply to specific goods and services listed in Annexes 3 and 10, respectively, excluding those classified under PKWiU 56 (food-related services). Zero rates apply to intra-EU supplies (Art. 42) and exports (Art. 2(8)(a)), including exports by registered farmers under certain documentation requirements (Art. 109(3)). Export zero rates require documentation confirming goods leaving EU territory, such as electronic records from customs systems, printed confirmations, or customs declarations, with specific validity rules (Art. 41(6)–(6a)). Late receipt of such documentation permits tax adjustments or deferred reporting under certain conditions (Art. 41(7), (9)). Special provisions apply to advance payments (Art. 41(9a)) and cross-border services (Art. 41(14a–f)), including retroactive rate application for services performed before a rate change. Social housing construction and maintenance services (Art. 41(12)) qualify for the 7% rate, with detailed exclusions and thresholds (Art. 41(12a–f)). The Minister may issue regulations lowering rates to 0%, 5%, or 7% for specific goods/services, subject to EU rules and budgetary considerations (Art. 41(16)).
