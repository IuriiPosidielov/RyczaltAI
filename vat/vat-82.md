Tax Exemptions for International Organizations Engaged in Public Benefit Activities in Poland

This article establishes the conditions under which international organizations operating within Poland for public benefit purposes — as defined by the Public Benefit Activities and Volunteering Act of April 24, 2003 — may be granted tax exemptions. Exemptions are to be applied under conditions specified in a regulation issued pursuant to paragraph 2. The Minister of Finance, in consultation with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, may issue regulations granting such exemptions to international organizations that meet both domestic public benefit criteria and are similarly exempted in other countries. The decision must consider: (1) accurate determination of the quantity and value of exempt goods; (2) the state’s economic situation; and (3) EU regulations. Additionally, the Minister of Finance may issue regulations establishing other tax exemptions beyond those in Articles 43–81, and specify detailed conditions for their application, including: (1) the nature of specific activities and commercial conditions for certain goods; (2) the state budget execution; (3) the need for adequate information on exempt goods; and (4) EU regulations.

International organizations engaged in public benefit activities in Poland may qualify for tax exemptions under conditions set by regulation, based on alignment with EU law, domestic public benefit criteria, and fiscal and economic considerations.
