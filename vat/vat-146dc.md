Taxation of Fuels and Bio-components – Poland (2022)

During the period from February 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022, the tax rate for the following fuels and bio-components intended for internal combustion engines was set at 8%:

1) Gasoline (CN 2710 12 45 or 2710 12 49) and products resulting from blending such gasoline with bio-components meeting specific quality requirements under separate regulations;

2) Diesel fuels (CN 2710 19 43 and 2710 20 11) and products resulting from blending such diesel with bio-components meeting specific quality requirements under separate regulations;

3) Bio-components that are themselves fuels, meeting specific quality requirements under separate regulations, regardless of their CN code;

4) Gaseous fuels (including wet natural gas and other gaseous hydrocarbons, CN 2711 excluding 2711 11 00 and 2711 21 00) and aliphatic gaseous hydrocarbons (CN 2901), when liquefied — all intended for internal combustion engines.

Note: This provision applies to fuels and bio-components meeting quality standards specified in separate regulations, and applies regardless of CN classification for bio-components used as standalone fuels.
