EU Tax Law – Traveler’s VAT Refund Rights

Persons without a fixed residence in the territory of the European Union, referred to herein as “travelers,” have the right to receive a refund of VAT paid upon acquisition of goods within the territory of a Member State, provided the goods are exported out of the EU by the traveler in their personal baggage, subject to paragraph 3 and Articles 127 and 128.

The fixed residence referred to in paragraph 1 is determined based on the passport or another document confirming identity.

A VAT refund does not apply in the case of the acquisition of motor fuels.
