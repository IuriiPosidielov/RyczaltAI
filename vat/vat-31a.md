Taxation: Foreign Currency Conversion Rules — Article 31a

This article establishes procedures for converting foreign currency amounts used to determine taxable bases into Polish złoty (PLN), including applicable exchange rates, permissible alternatives, and transitional rules for selected taxpayers.

Conversion is performed using the average exchange rate published by the National Bank of Poland (NBP) on the last business day before the tax obligation arises, unless the taxpayer elects to use the last published exchange rate from the European Central Bank (ECB) for euro-denominated amounts, with non-euro currencies converted via their respective euro exchange rates.

In cases where invoices are issued before the tax obligation arises, conversion uses the NBP rate on the last business day before invoice issuance, with the ECB option similarly applied.

Taxpayers may opt to apply income tax rules for foreign currency income (Art. 2a) — a choice binding for at least 12 months. Reversal of this choice requires reverting to standard conversion rules (Art. 1 or 2) for at least 12 months. If a transaction outside the chosen method occurs during the period, standard conversion rules must be applied to that transaction.

Import transactions follow customs conversion rules (Art. 3). For services at mass events (as defined in the 2009 Mass Events Safety Act), conversion follows customs valuation rules (Art. 4).

Special conversion rules apply for specific tax provisions (Art. 7a, 45, 48, 52, 56, 138a, 138i), using the ECB’s October 1st exchange rate of the prior tax year, with rounding to full złoty (50 groszy or more rounded up).

Foreign currency tax base conversion rules under Polish tax law, including NBP/ECB rate options, transitional periods, customs exceptions, and special rounding provisions for specific tax articles.
