- Exemptions for taxpayers with tax representatives (Art. 18d) or VAT groups (Art. 96.3b).  
- Registration procedures for VAT-exempt taxpayers seeking to resume taxable activities (Art. 5).  
- Automatic deregistration upon death, cessation of activity, or failure to comply with reporting obligations (Art. 7–8).

- Registration and deregistration procedures for VAT groups and their members (Art. 7ba, 7bb, 9k).  
- Special provisions for succession administrators and heirs (Art. 7b, 7c, 7d, 12a).  
- Administrative verification and certification of VAT registration status (Art. 13).  
- Special rules for international road transport service providers (Art. 14).

The article defines conditions under which registration may be denied or revoked (e.g., fraud suspicion, failure to respond to notices, or unverified data) and outlines liability for tax debts incurred by authorized representatives (Art. 4b). It also provides for automatic reinstatement upon resumption of activity or correction of administrative errors (Art. 9h, 9i, 9k).
