VAT Law – Fiscal Documentation – Third-Party Invoice Issuance Rights

A taxpayer referred to in Article 106b(1)(1) may issue invoices on behalf of and in the name of the supplier under the following conditions:  
1) Invoices documenting the supplier’s sale to that taxpayer;  
2) Invoices as specified in Article 106b(1)(4);  
3) Invoices documenting the supply of goods or services referred to in Article 106a(2)(b), provided that the taxpayer and supplier previously entered into an agreement authorizing such third-party invoicing, including a defined procedure for the supplier’s approval of individual invoices.

Additionally, a third party authorized by the taxpayer — such as a tax representative under Article 18a — may also issue invoices on behalf of and in the name of the taxpayer.

Summary: VAT law permits authorized third parties, including tax representatives, to issue invoices on behalf of a supplier under specific contractual and procedural conditions, primarily within the domain of VAT documentation and cross-entity transaction compliance.
