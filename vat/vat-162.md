Tax Law – Polish VAT Declaration Rules (May 2004 & Q2 2004)

In the tax return filed for May 2004 or the second quarter of 2004, the amount of tax calculated but not settled in prior periods, under Article 19(4) of the law referenced in Article 175, must be included.

Regarding the excess tax calculated over the due amount, as referred to in Article 21(1) of the law referenced in Article 175, arising from the last tax return filed before the law came into force, Article 87 applies.

A taxpayer who, in April 2004:
   a) received an invoice or customs document, or
   b) made an entry in the register (in the case of simplified import procedures),
   and was entitled, under the law referenced in Article 175, to reduce the tax due in the May 2004 tax return, but did not reduce it in the April 2004 tax return, may make that reduction in the May 2004 tax return.

If, in the last tax period before May 1, 2004, the taxpayer incurred a tax liability for imported services and was entitled, under the law referenced in Article 175, to reduce the tax due in the next tax period, but did not do so previously, they may make that reduction in the first tax period following April 30, 2004.
