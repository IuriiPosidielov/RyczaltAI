VAT Group Intracommunity Transactions – Polish VAT Law (Art. 8c)

This article governs VAT treatment of intra-group transactions within a VAT group in Poland, including cross-border and intra-entity supply rules for goods and services, with specific provisions for group members, non-members, and foreign branches.

1. Supplies of goods and services between members of the same VAT group are exempt from VAT.

2. Supplies from a VAT group member to a third-party entity outside the group are treated as if made by the VAT group as a whole.

3. Supplies from a non-group entity to a VAT group member are treated as if made to the VAT group.

4. Supplies from a group member’s branch (within Poland) to:
   a) a non-resident taxpayer (without a seat in the country where the branch is located), or
   b) another branch of the same taxpayer located outside the country — are treated as if made by the VAT group to a non-member.

5. Supplies to a group member’s branch (within Poland) from:
   a) a non-resident taxpayer (without a seat in the country where the branch is located), or
   b) another branch of the same taxpayer located outside the country — are treated as if made by a non-member to the VAT group.

6. Supplies from a Polish-resident taxpayer to a branch of a VAT group established in a non-Polish EU member state are treated as made to the VAT group.

7. Supplies from a branch of a VAT group established in a non-Polish EU member state to a Polish-resident taxpayer are treated as made by the VAT group.

This article establishes VAT group consolidation rules for intra-group and cross-border transactions, defining legal attribution of supplies within and outside the group for VAT purposes under Polish VAT law.
