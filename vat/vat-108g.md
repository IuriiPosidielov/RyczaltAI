VAT e-Invoicing Obligations for Buyers and Paying Taxpayers – Polish VAT Law (Art. 108g)

This provision outlines the obligation of VAT-registered buyers or other paying taxpayers to provide invoice identifiers to the National e-Invoicing System when making payments via electronic payment instruments or payment orders. The requirement applies to structured invoices and invoices referenced in Art. 106nda and 106nh, as well as to payments made on behalf of VAT-registered buyers. The status of the VAT-registered recipient is verified based on the official VAT register as of the payment date. Special provisions apply when payments are made via payment orders, shifting the obligation to the invoice issuer. Exemptions apply where invoices are not submitted to the National e-Invoicing System due to specific communication requirements under Art. 106ne.
