For services related to entry to cultural, artistic, sports, scientific, educational, entertainment, or similar events (including fairs and exhibitions), and associated auxiliary services provided to VAT taxpayers, where physical presence is required, the place of supply is the actual location where the event takes place.

For services in the fields of culture, art, sport, science, education, entertainment, and similar services (including fairs and exhibitions), and associated auxiliary services, including those provided by organizers, to non-VAT taxpayers, the place of supply is the actual location where the activity is carried out.
