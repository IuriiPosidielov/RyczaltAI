VAT Cash Management – Tax Authority Authorization for Transfer of VAT Account Funds (Poland)

This article establishes the legal framework for taxpayers to request authorization from the head of a tax office to transfer funds accumulated on their VAT account to a designated bank account or cooperative savings and credit society account. The request must specify the amount to be transferred, and the tax authority must issue a decision within 60 days. Authorization is granted unless the taxpayer has outstanding tax liabilities or there is a justified concern that tax obligations will not be fulfilled — such as persistent non-payment or asset disposal hindering enforcement. Special provisions apply to public budgetary entities, dissolved civil or commercial partnerships (where former partners may also apply), and non-taxpayers (including entities whose funds were transferred to a technical VAT account under banking law). Decisions are communicated electronically to the relevant financial institution, including account details and transfer amount. The provisions also address cases involving technical VAT accounts under banking law, including authorization for withdrawal of funds from such accounts, with similar procedural requirements and eligibility criteria. The rules apply to both taxpayers and non-taxpayers, with jurisdiction determined by residential or business address.
