Legal Framework: VAT Directive – Article 22 – Place of Delivery

This provision defines the legal criteria for determining the place of delivery of goods under the VAT Directive, applicable across EU member states and involving cross-border, intra-community, and domestic transactions. It establishes rules for goods shipped or transported by the supplier, buyer, or third parties; goods delivered via distance selling (including intra-community and non-intra-community imports); goods requiring installation or assembly; non-shipped goods; goods delivered on transport vehicles during passenger travel within the EU; and energy/gas deliveries through distribution networks to businesses or end-users.

It also addresses special cases: multiple deliveries in a chain, deliveries through intermediaries, and the allocation of transport to specific transactions. Additionally, it clarifies how to treat transport during passenger journeys within the EU, including definitions of “start” and “end” points of passenger transport, and how to handle return journeys.

Exclusions apply to goods covered by Article 120, particularly those subject to specific VAT rules in the country of origin or delivered at auctions under special regimes.

This article establishes the legal framework for determining the place of delivery of goods under EU VAT rules, covering various delivery modalities, cross-border scenarios, and special cases involving intermediaries, energy deliveries, and passenger transport — all aimed at harmonizing VAT application across EU member states.
