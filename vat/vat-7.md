Transfer of Goods – Legal Definitions for Tax Purposes (Polish Tax Law)

This text defines “delivery of goods” under Article 5(1)(1) of the Polish Corporate Income Tax Act, specifying when such delivery constitutes a transfer of ownership or equivalent rights for tax purposes. It covers:

- Transfers mandated by public authorities or entities acting on their behalf, or transfers in exchange for compensation;
- Leases, rentals, and similar contracts (including installment sales) where ownership transfers upon fulfillment of contractual conditions or final payment;
- Commission agreements (between commissioner and principal, and between commissioner and third parties);
- Delivery by commissioner to principal under commission agreements when commissioner is obligated to acquire goods on principal’s account;
- Establishment or conversion of co-operative ownership or tenancy rights in residential premises, including conversion of tenancy rights into ownership rights, and creation of separate ownership rights for members;
- Permanent land use rights;
- Transfer of rights related to the above.

Additionally, it defines “free transfer” of goods by taxpayers to themselves, employees, former employees, partners, shareholders, co-operative members, and their dependents, as well as other gifts—provided the taxpayer had a right to reduce tax liability on those goods.

Exemptions apply to small-value gifts and samples used for business purposes, with specific thresholds: gifts valued under 100 PLN (excluding VAT) per recipient if taxpayer maintains proper records; or items with unit cost not exceeding 20 PLN if not recorded.

“Samples” are defined as identifiable units or small quantities intended for product evaluation and promotional purposes, not primarily for satisfying end-user needs, unless such satisfaction is integral to promoting the product and incentivizes purchase.

“Lease, rental, or similar contracts” include agreements where the user is entitled to depreciation deductions under tax law, including land leasing contracts.

This definition is used to determine whether a transaction qualifies as a delivery of goods for tax purposes, including for VAT and income tax calculations.
