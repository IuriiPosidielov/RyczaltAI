VAT Law – Article 13c: Conditions for Deemed Non-Occurrence of Intra-Community Acquisition During Substitute Taxpayer Replacement

This provision establishes the legal conditions under which an intra-community acquisition of goods (as defined in Article 11, paragraph 1) is deemed not to have occurred during the period in which a VAT taxpayer is replaced by another taxpayer, provided the replacement meets specific formal and procedural requirements. These include: (1) the substitute taxpayer must hold legal rights to dispose of the goods under an agreement with the original taxpayer; (2) the original taxpayer must lack a business establishment or fixed place of business in the country; (3) the substitute taxpayer must be registered as a VAT taxpayer in the EU, with identifiable name and VAT identification number (prefixed with “PL”) known to the original taxpayer at the time of replacement; (4) the original taxpayer must report the substitute’s VAT ID in the summary information required under Article 100, paragraph 1, point 5; and (5) the replacement must be registered in the taxpayer’s records as required under Article 54a, paragraph 1, of Regulation 282/2011.
