**Tax Law — Polish VAT Classification and Rate Determination System (WIS) — Revocation and Amendment Procedures**

Article 42h of the Polish Tax Code governs the automatic expiration of the WIS (Wspólna Informacja Skarbowo-Administracyjna — Common Tax and Administrative Information) when changes in Polish or EU tax legislation render its classification or rate provisions invalid. Revocation occurs automatically on the effective date of the conflicting legal amendment. The WIS may also be amended or revoked by the Director of the National Tax Information Office (NKIS) upon detection of legal inconsistencies, including misclassification under the Harmonized System (HS), EU classification rulings, or procedural irregularities. The Director may initiate proceedings unilaterally or upon request from the Head of the National Tax Administration. Upon completion of such proceedings, the WIS may be revoked, amended, or dismissed as irrelevant. The Head of the National Tax Administration may also request the Director to initiate such proceedings, and the Director must promptly respond. The Director may also transfer ongoing proceedings to the Head of the National Tax Administration. These provisions apply analogously to other final administrative decisions related to WIS issuance.

**Summary**: Polish tax law provides automatic expiration and administrative procedures for revoking or amending the WIS when legal changes invalidate its classification or rate provisions, governed by the Director of the National Tax Information Office and the Head of the National Tax Administration.
