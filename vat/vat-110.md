Tax Law – Polish Tax Code – Article 110: Procedures for Determining Taxable Sales Value and Tax Liability When Documentation Is Insufficient

When legal entities, organizational units without legal personality, and individuals are not required to maintain the records specified in Article 109(3) in connection with tax-exempt sales under Articles 43 and 82(3), but subsequently conduct taxable sales without paying the due tax, and the value of such sales cannot be determined from documentation, the tax authority shall estimate the value of the taxable sale and determine the amount of tax due. If the taxable object cannot be identified, the tax amount shall be calculated using the 22% rate.
