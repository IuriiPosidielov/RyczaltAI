VAT-registered occasional transport providers – Filing Obligations and Declaration Requirements

VAT-registered occasional transport service providers are required to electronically submit tax declarations to the second tax office for VAT settlement purposes regarding services referred to in Article 134a(1), by the 25th day of the month following the quarter in which the tax liability arose. The declaration must include: (1) the identification number as per Article 134a(4); (2) bus registration number, number of passengers transported, and value of services rendered within Poland without VAT; (3) total value of domestic services without VAT forming the tax base; (4) applicable tax rate; and (5) total VAT amount due for payment to the tax office. All amounts must be expressed in Polish zloty. If payments for services under Article 134a(1) were made in currencies other than Polish zloty, conversion to zloty shall follow customs regulations for determining the customs value of imported goods. Taxpayers must independently calculate and remit the due VAT in Polish zloty to the second tax office’s bank account by the deadline specified in paragraph 1, without requiring a summons from the head of the tax office.
