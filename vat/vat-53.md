**Customs Duty Exemption for Business Equipment Import – Poland (Art. 53)**

This provision establishes conditions under which entrepreneurs may be exempt from customs duties when importing fixed assets and equipment for business use, provided they have ceased operations in a third country and intend to resume similar activities domestically. Exemption requires: (1) prior 12-month use of equipment in the former jurisdiction; (2) continued intended use in Poland for the same business purpose; and (3) equipment type and quantity aligned with domestic business scale. 

Exemption also extends to live livestock for agricultural holdings. It does not apply if cessation results from business mergers, acquisitions, or transfers without initiating new domestic activity. Excluded items include non-business transport, consumer goods, fuels, raw material stocks, and livestock owned by animal traders. 

Equipment must be declared for customs clearance within 12 months of ceasing foreign operations to qualify. For 12 months (extendable to 36 months with justification), exempt goods cannot be pledged, sold, leased, used, or otherwise disposed of without prior customs notification. Any subsequent disposition before this period triggers reapplication of customs duties at the time of transfer, using the customs value determined on that date.

Applies to self-employed individuals with recognized professional rights in Poland and legal entities transferring non-commercial activities from a third country.
