Employment Tax Law – Article 104: Conditions for Applying Cash Method of Tax Settlement for New Business Starters

This provision extends the rules of Articles 21 and 86(10e) to taxpayers who begin performing activities defined in Article 5 during the tax year, provided their projected sales value—calculated proportionally to the duration of business activity—does not exceed the thresholds specified in Article 2(25). If the threshold is exceeded, the taxpayer loses the right to use the cash method of tax settlement starting from the tax period following the quarter in which the threshold was breached, and for the next tax year.
