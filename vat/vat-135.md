VAT Law – Definitions and Simplified Procedure for Tripartite Intra-Community Transactions

1. The term “VAT” refers to the value-added tax.  
2. “Tripartite intra-community transaction” means a transaction meeting all of the following conditions:  
   a) Three VAT-registered entities from three different Member States participate in a goods delivery, where the first entity directly delivers goods to the last entity in sequence, with delivery occurring between the first and second, and the second and last entities;  
   b) The goods are shipped or transported by the first or second VAT-registered entity—or on their behalf—from the territory of one Member State to the territory of another Member State.  
3. “Intra-community acquisition of goods” means acquiring ownership rights over goods that are shipped or transported to the territory of a Member State other than the one where the dispatch or transport originated, by the acquirer or on their behalf.  
4. “Simplified procedure” refers to a VAT settlement method in a tripartite intra-community transaction, whereby the last VAT-registered entity settles VAT on goods received directly from the second VAT-registered entity, provided all of the following conditions are met:  
   a) The delivery to the last VAT-registered entity was directly preceded by an intra-community acquisition of goods from the second VAT-registered entity;  
   b) The second VAT-registered entity does not have a place of business in the Member State where the transport or shipment concludes;  
   c) The second VAT-registered entity uses the same VAT identification number assigned by a Member State other than the one where the transport or shipment begins or ends, for both the first and last VAT-registered entities;  
   d) The last VAT-registered entity uses the VAT identification number assigned by the Member State where the transport or shipment concludes;  
   e) The second VAT-registered entity has indicated the last VAT-registered entity as being liable for VAT settlement on the goods delivered under the simplified procedure.  

2. The simplified procedure also applies if the last entity is a legal person that is not a VAT taxpayer or is not subject to VAT under Article 15, and is identified for intra-community transactions in the Member State where the goods are located at the end of transport or shipment; in such cases, the intra-community acquisition of goods is deemed to have been taxed by the second VAT-registered entity.
