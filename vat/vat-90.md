**VAT Law – Article 90: Proportional Deduction of Tax Paid Based on Business Activities**

This article establishes rules for calculating the proportion of VAT paid that may be deducted from the total VAT liability, based on the taxpayer’s business activities that qualify for deduction versus those that do not. The taxpayer must separately identify VAT paid related to deductible activities (Art. 90.1). If separation is not feasible, the taxpayer may deduct a proportional share of VAT paid attributable to deductible activities (Art. 90.2), subject to Art. 90.10 limitations.

The proportion is calculated as the annual turnover from deductible activities divided by total turnover (deductible + non-deductible activities) (Art. 90.3). This proportion is expressed as an annual percentage based on turnover from the preceding tax year, rounded up to the nearest whole number (Art. 90.4).

Turnover excludes: (1) sales of goods/services treated as fixed assets or intangible assets subject to amortization; (2) land and perpetual usufruct rights treated as fixed assets; (3) transactions related to real estate or financial assistance transactions; (4) services listed in Art. 43(1) pts. 7, 12, 38–41, if they are ancillary (Art. 90.5–6).

For taxpayers with zero or below-30,000 zł turnover in the prior year, a provisional proportion is applied (Art. 90.8). Such taxpayers must notify the tax office within 25 days of the month following application, or no later than the date of submission of the tax return (Art. 109(3)).

The same rules apply if the taxpayer deems the turnover figure unrepresentative (Art. 90.9). VAT itself is excluded from turnover calculations when determining the proportion (Art. 90.9a).

If the calculated proportion exceeds 98% and the undeductible VAT amount is less than 10,000 zł annually, the taxpayer may treat the proportion as 100% (Art. 90.10.1). If the proportion is below 2%, it may be treated as 0% (Art. 90.10.2).

For local government units, the proportion is calculated separately for each organizational unit (Art. 90.10a), with corresponding application of Art. 90.3–6, 8–10.

For VAT groups, the proportion is calculated separately for each member (Art. 90.10c). In the year a VAT group obtains taxpayer status, the proportion is based on the value set at the time of group formation. Rules from Art. 90.3–6, 8–10, 90a, 90b, and 91(1–9) apply accordingly.

If a VAT group purchases goods/services used for both deductible and non-deductible activities and cannot allocate them to individual members, the group must separately identify VAT paid for deductible activities (Art. 90.10d). If allocation is impossible, a provisional proportion is applied, calculated as in Art. 90.2. Rules from Art. 90.3–6, 8–10, 90a, 90b, and 91(1–9) apply.

For taxpayers re-registered under Art. 96(9k) after being part of a VAT group, the previously established proportion remains unchanged until the end of the year in which the group lost its VAT status (Art. 90.10e). Art. 91(1–9) applies to each former group member. Art. 90.8 and 90.9 do not apply in this case.

If a taxpayer re-registered under Art. 96(9k) deems the turnover figure unrepresentative, a provisional proportion is applied (Art. 90.10f). Notification to the tax office must occur within 25 days of application or no later than the return submission date (Art. 109(3)).

For such taxpayers, turnover includes both activity during group membership and activity after group status loss (Art. 90.10g).

The Finance Minister may issue regulations establishing alternative methods for calculating the proportion (Art. 90.11), considering economic turnover and EU law. The Minister may also specify cases where a proportion exceeding 98% may be treated as 100% if the undeductible VAT is 10,000 zł or more (Art. 90.12), considering economic conditions and business nature.
