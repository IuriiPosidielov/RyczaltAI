VAT Framework Definitions – EU Taxation Law

This article establishes key terminology for VAT purposes under EU law, defining terms used throughout the chapter, including: VAT, which refers to the value-added tax; Services, which refers to services rendered to persons who are not VAT-registered taxpayers under Article 28a, where the place of performance is within the territory of the consumer’s Member State; Taxpayers, which includes legal persons, organizational units without legal personality, and natural persons who carry out cross-border distance sales of goods, facilitate the delivery of goods under Article 7a(2) if the shipment or transport begins and ends within the same Member State, or have a business establishment or fixed place of business in the EU but not in the consumer’s Member State and provide services to non-VAT-registered persons under Article 28a; Consumer Member State, which refers to the Member State where the delivery or transport of goods ends (for distance sales), the Member State where the delivery begins and ends (for facilitation under Article 7a(2)), or the Member State where services are performed; Identifying Member State, which refers to the Member State where the taxpayer has a business establishment, or where the taxpayer has a fixed place of business (if no EU establishment exists), or where the taxpayer selects a fixed place of business (among multiple ones in the EU) to submit an advance notification for using the EU procedure, or where the shipment or transport originates from (if multiple Member States are involved, the taxpayer selects one for notification), provided no EU establishment or fixed place of business exists; and EU Procedure, which refers to the VAT settlement process for transactions listed in points 2(a)–(c), whereby the VAT due to the consumer Member State is settled through the identifying Member State.
