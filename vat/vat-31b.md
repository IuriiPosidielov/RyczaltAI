Taxation of foreign currency amounts — Polish VAT Law (Art. 31b)

This article establishes rules for converting foreign currency amounts used to determine taxable base into Polish złoty, with specific provisions for corrected invoices, price reductions, and exceptions for taxpayers applying alternative conversion methods under Art. 31a.

Conversion is performed using either:
- The average exchange rate published by the National Bank of Poland on the last business day before the invoice date, or
- The last published exchange rate by the European Central Bank on the day preceding the invoice date, with cross-currency conversions against the euro for non-euro currencies.

These rules do not apply if the taxpayer has chosen the conversion methods specified in Art. 31a ust. 2a; in such cases, transactions not covered by those methods must follow the rules of Art. 31b ust. 1 or 2.
