VAT Liability for Goods from Dissolved or Suspended Entities – Polish Tax Code

This article establishes the VAT liability for goods of self-produced origin or goods acquired but not previously delivered, in specific dissolution or cessation scenarios, including: (1) dissolution of civil or commercial partnerships without legal personality; (2) cessation of activity by taxpayers under Art. 15 (individuals or businesses in succession) who failed to notify the tax office under Art. 96(6); (3) expiration of successor management or appointment rights where no successor management was appointed and Art. 12(1c) notification was filed. Exemptions apply to taxpayers whose sales are VAT-exempt under Art. 113(1,9) or Art. 113a(1). The obligation applies only if activity ceased for at least 10 months (excluding suspended activities). VAT liability arises on the day of dissolution or cessation. Taxpayers must prepare and submit a “natural inventory” of goods, along with the VAT amount due, no later than when filing the tax return covering the relevant period. Goods subject to inventory are taxed based on value under Art. 29a(2). A VAT refund may be claimed by former partners or successor entities under specific conditions, including submission of partnership agreements, bank account statements, and proportional allocation based on profit-sharing or ownership rights. Refunds are issued to designated bank accounts, with interest applied if documents are submitted after the deadline or if the refund is delayed due to verification. Refunds deposited in escrow are not interest-bearing, except as specified in Art. 9j. Art. 99 applies for VAT settlement on goods subject to the inventory.

Polish VAT rules trigger liability for unsold inventory upon dissolution or cessation of activity, requiring a mandatory inventory, tax declaration, and potential refund mechanisms for former partners or successor entities — all governed under VAT law and inventory procedures.
