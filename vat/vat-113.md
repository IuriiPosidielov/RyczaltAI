VAT Exemption for Small-Scale Sellers – Polish VAT Law (Art. 113)

This provision establishes VAT exemption conditions for taxpayers whose sales value (excluding VAT) does not exceed 240,000 zł in the prior or current tax year. Excluded from the sales value calculation are: intra-Community distance sales not subject to domestic VAT, certain exempt deliveries and services (with exceptions for real estate, specific services under Art. 43, and insurance services), and deliveries of goods classified as fixed assets or intangible assets under corporate income tax rules.

Exemption may be waived by written notification to the tax office head before the start of the relevant month, or before the first qualifying activity if the taxpayer begins operations mid-year. Exemption lapses if sales exceed the 240,000 zł threshold, starting from the transaction that breaches it.

New entrepreneurs beginning operations mid-year may also qualify if their projected sales, prorated by the duration of activity, remain under the threshold. If actual sales exceed the limit during the year, exemption lapses from the transaction that breaches it.

In cases where enforcement authorities or bailiffs cannot verify required information for distance sales (Art. 18), exemption is deemed not applicable.

Lost or waived exemptions may be reactivated after one full tax year following loss or waiver, with special provisions for self-employed individuals restarting qualifying activities.

Exemption does not apply to sales of specific goods (e.g., listed in Annex 12, excisable goods, real estate, land, new transport, or certain distance sales of cosmetics, electronics, appliances, etc.) or specific services (e.g., legal, advisory, jewelry, debt collection).
