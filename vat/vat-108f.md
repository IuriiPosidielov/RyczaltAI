Tax Law – VAT and Business Account Costs Refund Procedure (Poland)

This article establishes the procedure for refunding business account and VAT account costs for taxpayers without a business establishment or permanent place of business within Poland. The refund is processed by the head of the second tax office upon taxpayer request and covers costs related to the use of accounts specified in Article 108e and VAT accounts maintained for those purposes, specifically for mandatory split-payment mechanisms under Article 108a(1a). Applications may be submitted quarterly, semi-annually, or annually, within 25 days after the end of the relevant period. Applicants must specify the refund amount and the designated settlement or named savings-credit cooperative account. Supporting documentation verifying incurred costs must be attached. Refunds are issued in Polish zlotys to the specified account within 30 days of receipt. If clarification is needed, the tax office may request additional explanations, delaying the refund to no later than 30 days after receiving those clarifications — without accruing interest for delays. Refusal is formalized via a decision subject to appeal. Unaddressed matters fall under Chapter IV of the Tax Ordinance.
