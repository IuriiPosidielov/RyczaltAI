**Tax Law – Adjustment of Tax Deducted for Goods and Services (Poland)**

This article establishes procedures for adjusting previously deducted tax on acquired goods and services when the taxpayer was entitled to a tax reduction under Article 86(2a), following the end of the tax year. The adjustment must be made to reflect the correct amount of tax deducted, based on data from the completed tax year, and must follow the rules of Article 91(2)–(9) accordingly.

In cases where the taxpayer’s method of determining the proportionality factor is governed by regulations issued under Article 86(22), the taxpayer may use data from the tax year immediately preceding the prior tax year—provided such data was already used to calculate the tax amount under Article 86(2a).

When performing the adjustment under paragraph 1, the taxpayer may adopt a different method of determining the proportionality factor if it more accurately reflects the completed tax year’s circumstances, even if it differs from the method applied in the original tax year.

**Retrieval Summary**: Polish tax law provisions governing post-year adjustments of tax deductions for goods and services, referencing Articles 86 and 91, with flexibility for proportionality methods and cross-year data application.
