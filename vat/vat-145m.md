Polish VAT Law – Transitional Provisions for Structured Invoices (2026)

In the period from April 1, 2026, to December 31, 2026, taxpayers obligated to issue structured invoices may issue either electronic invoices or paper invoices, provided the total value of sales (including VAT) documented by such invoices in any given month does not exceed 10,000 zł.  
From the first invoice exceeding this threshold, the taxpayer loses the right to issue both electronic and paper invoices.

Taxpayers may issue electronic or paper invoices during the 2026 transition period if monthly sales (including VAT) remain at or below 10,000 zł — exceeding this amount triggers loss of eligibility for both formats.
