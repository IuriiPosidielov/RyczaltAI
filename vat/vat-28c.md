Taxation of Services – Determination of Place of Service Provision (Poland)

For services rendered to entities that are not VAT taxpayers, the place of service provision is the location of the service provider’s business establishment, subject to the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3, and Articles 28d, 28e, 28f (paragraphs 1–3), 28g (paragraphs 2–3), and 28h–28n.  
If services are rendered from a fixed place of business of the service provider located elsewhere than their main business establishment, the place of service provision is that fixed place of business.  
If the service provider does not have a business establishment or a fixed place of business as referred to in paragraph 2, the place of service provision is the location of their permanent residence or habitual place of stay.

Place of service provision for VAT purposes under Polish tax law, governed by Articles 28c–28n, determines jurisdiction for VAT registration and reporting obligations when service recipients are non-VAT taxpayers.
