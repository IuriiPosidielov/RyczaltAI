**Tax Law – VAT Adjustment and Partial Deduction Rules (Poland)**

Article 89b.1. If a debt arising from an invoice documenting the supply of goods or provision of services within the country remains unpaid within 90 days of the payment deadline specified in the contract or on the invoice, the debtor must adjust the VAT deduction claimed in the tax return for the period in which the 90-day deadline expires.

Article 89b.1a. The provisions of paragraph 1 do not apply if the debtor settles the debt no later than the last day of the tax period in which the 90-day deadline expires.

Article 89b.2. In the case of partial payment of the debt within the 90-day period from the payment deadline specified in the contract or on the invoice, the adjustment applies only to the VAT portion corresponding to the unpaid portion of the debt. Paragraph 1a applies accordingly.

Article 89b.4. If the debt is settled after the adjustment referred to in paragraph 1, the taxpayer may increase the VAT amount claimed in the tax return for the period in which the debt was settled by the amount of VAT adjusted under paragraph 1. In the case of partial payment, the adjustment may also apply to the unpaid portion.
