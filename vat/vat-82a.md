**Customs & Tax Law – Article 82a – Conditions for Tax Exemption on Goods Delivery**

If documented actions by enforcement authorities or court bailiffs, as referred to in Article 18, fail to confirm fulfillment of the conditions for applying tax exemptions on goods delivery under Article 18, due to the debtor’s inability to provide necessary information, it shall be deemed that the conditions for applying the tax exemptions under Articles 82(2) and (3) have not been met.

*Rationale: This provision addresses procedural limitations in verifying eligibility for tax exemptions when debtor information is unavailable, ensuring compliance with formal requirements under customs and tax regulations.*

**Summary**: Under Polish customs and tax law, failure to obtain debtor information from enforcement authorities or bailiffs prevents the automatic assumption of tax exemption eligibility for goods delivery under Article 82a.
