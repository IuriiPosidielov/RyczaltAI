Polish VAT Law – Electronic Invoicing & Structured Invoice Requirements (Article 106gb)

Structured electronic invoices must be issued and received using the National e-Invoice System via approved interface software, in electronic format and conforming to the definition of electronic document under the Act of February 17, 2005, on the informatization of public service entities.

The interface software is available via the official website listed in the Public Information Bulletin of the minister’s administrative office responsible for public finance.

Access to structured invoices—including those under Articles 106nda, 106nf, and 106nh, as well as VAT RR and VAT RR CORRECTION invoices issued via the National e-Invoice System—is granted without authentication using a unique code (Article 106gb, paragraph 5) after providing identifying data.

Special provisions apply when:
- The service location is outside Poland or a third country;
- The buyer lacks a business establishment or fixed place of business in Poland;
- The buyer has a fixed place of business in Poland, but it is not involved in the transaction;
- The buyer qualifies for relief under Article 113a, paragraph 1;
- The buyer does not use a tax identification number or other identifier;
- The buyer is a natural person not conducting business.

In such cases, the structured invoice must be delivered to the buyer by mutually agreed means.

Every taxpayer must affix a unique verification code to any structured invoice:
- If delivered to the buyer under paragraph 4 (except via the National e-Invoice System), or
- If used outside the National e-Invoice System.

Non-taxpayers using such invoices outside the system must also affix the verification code.

If a structured invoice is issued to a buyer under paragraph 4, points 5 and 6, and received via the National e-Invoice System, the taxpayer must ensure the buyer can access the invoice via the system using the verification code and identifying data.

Structured electronic invoices issued under the Act of November 9, 2018, on electronic invoicing in public procurement, construction concessions, and public-private partnerships (Journal of Laws 2020, item 1666; 2023, item 1598)—transmitted via the platform under Article 1, paragraph 1, or OpenPEPPOL system under Article 2, paragraph 2, and complying with EU standards under Article 9, paragraph 1—are recognized as structured invoices after transmission to the National e-Invoice System and assignment of an identification number.

The Minister of Finance publishes the official structured invoice template on the public administration’s electronic service platform.

Structured electronic invoicing under Polish VAT law, governed by Article 106gb, requires use of the National e-Invoice System, interface software, and unique verification codes for access and validation, with special provisions for cross-border or non-resident buyers and compliance with EU standards for public procurement and OpenPEPPOL systems.
