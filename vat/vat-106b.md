VAT Invoice Obligations under Polish VAT Law — Article 106b

This article establishes when and under what conditions a VAT taxpayer must issue an invoice documenting taxable transactions, including sales, deliveries of goods, and provision of services, particularly in cross-border contexts, and when such obligations may be waived or modified.

Key obligations include:
- Issuing invoices for sales, deliveries, and services rendered to other VAT taxpayers or legal entities not registered as taxpayers.
- Issuing invoices for cross-border distance sales unless opting for special procedures (Chapter XII, Section 6a).
- Issuing invoices for deliveries to entities not covered under point 1.
- Issuing invoices when receiving partial or full payment prior to performing the taxable transaction — with exceptions for cross-border deliveries, transactions under Article 19a(5)(4), and deliveries under Article 19a(1)(b).
- Waiver of invoice obligation for tax-exempt transactions under Articles 43, 113, 113a, and regulations under Article 82(3).
- Obligation to issue invoices upon request by the customer, including for transactions exempt from mandatory invoicing under Article 106b(1), excluding those under Article 19a(5)(4), Article 106a(3), and Article 106a(4), and for prepayment cases not covered by exemptions.
- Special provisions for taxpayers using special procedures under Chapters 6a, 7, and 9 of Part XII.
- Requirements for issuing invoices when using fiscal receipts with identification numbers for VAT taxpayers.
- Penalties for issuing invalid invoices under Article 5 — 100% of the VAT amount is assessed as additional tax liability, unless the offender is a natural person facing administrative or criminal liability for tax offenses.
