Customs Law – Definition of Taxpayers (Article 17)

This article defines who qualifies as a taxpayer under customs law, including legal entities, organizational units without legal personality, and natural persons under specific conditions. Taxpayer status applies even when duties are waived, suspended, or reduced (e.g., preferential or zero rates), or when entities use active customs simplification or temporary clearance procedures, including those transferred via separate provisions. It also covers intra-community acquisitions of goods and acquisitions of services under defined criteria (e.g., service providers without a local business establishment, and service recipients with specific registration or residency requirements). Similarly, goods acquisitions are taxable if delivered by non-resident taxpayers under specified conditions. Tax liability also arises under Article 42, paragraphs 8 and 10. Special provisions apply when service providers or goods deliverers have a fixed establishment in the country — but only if that establishment does not participate in the transaction. If a taxpayer has appointed a tax representative (Article 18d), that representative acts as the taxpayer for actions performed in their own name. Organizational units without legal personality that are part of an inheritance are considered taxpayers during the period from the opening of the inheritance until the expiration of the succession management or the appointment of a successor manager, provided proper notification is filed. Such entities are treated as continuing the deceased taxpayer’s business activities.

Customs law defines taxpayer status broadly to include entities under specific transactional, procedural, or legal conditions — even when duties are suspended or reduced — with special rules for services, goods, succession, and tax representatives, all within the context of EU customs and VAT frameworks.
