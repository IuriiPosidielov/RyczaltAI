VAT Registration and Agricultural Product Purchase Documentation — Poland (Art. 116, VAT Act)

This legal text establishes the procedural and formal requirements for VAT-registered businesses acquiring agricultural products from self-employed farmers (ryczałtowcy) under Poland’s VAT regime. It mandates specific content and formatting for “Faktura VAT RR” (VAT RR Invoice), including mandatory fields such as taxpayer identification, product descriptions, tax-free refund amounts, and electronic transmission rules. The invoice must be issued in two copies, with one retained by the supplier, and must be signed either manually or via qualified electronic signature. Electronic issuance via the National e-Invoicing System (Krajowy System e-Faktur) is permitted starting April 1, 2026, with corresponding technical and compliance rules. Correction invoices (Faktura VAT RR KOREKTA) are required for any material changes, returns, or payment adjustments, and must follow strict formatting and timing rules. The rules also govern the timing of invoice issuance (within 7 days of purchase or next month for continuous deliveries), the treatment of tax refunds in VAT returns, and the retention period (10 years for e-invoiced documents). Special provisions apply to electronic signatures, cross-border currency conversion, and documentation of payments made to farmers’ bank accounts or cooperatives.
