Tax Law – Polish Income Tax Act – Article 163 (2004–2005 Tax Period Adjustment Rules)

This article establishes transitional rules for calculating deductible tax amounts under Article 90 for taxpayers whose 2003 turnover exceeded 30,000 PLN from activities subject to or not subject to taxation. It mandates using a proportion derived from 2003 turnover (as per Articles 90, paragraphs 3–8) to determine deductible tax for the May–December 2004 reporting period, adjusted for statutory tax reductions. If the taxpayer deems the 2003 turnover non-representative, Article 90, paragraph 9 applies. Article 91 corrections for 2004 relate to the May–December 2004 period, using turnover from that period to calculate the proportion, which then applies in 2005 for Article 90 deductions. For fixed assets and intangible assets acquired before May 1, 2004, Article 20, paragraph 5 of the relevant tax law (referenced in Article 175) applies.
