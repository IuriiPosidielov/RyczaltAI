Transport Law – Service Provision Location Rules for Vehicle and Vessel Rentals

Article 28j.  
The place of provision of short-term vehicle rental services is the location where the transport vehicle is actually handed over to the service recipient.  
“Short-term rental of transport vehicles” as referred to in paragraph 1 means continuous possession or use of the vehicle for no more than 30 days, and for watercraft, no more than 90 days.  
The place of provision of rental services other than short-term rentals, rendered to non-taxpayers, is the location where the service recipient has their registered office, habitual residence, or usual place of stay, subject to paragraph 4.  
The place of provision of recreational vessel rental services (other than short-term rentals) to non-taxpayers is the location where the vessel is actually handed over to the service recipient, provided that the service provider actually renders the service from their business establishment or fixed place of business located at that location.

Short-term vehicle and vessel rental service locations are determined by actual handover points or recipient’s residential/business ties, with specific duration limits and exceptions for recreational vessels.
