VAT Correction Procedure for Polish Consumption Jurisdiction – Electronic Submission Requirements

This provision establishes the obligation of taxpayers (or their intermediaries) to submit VAT declarations corrections electronically to the Łódź Tax Office, under specific conditions defined in Regulation 282/2011, particularly when deadlines under Article 61(2) or situations under Article 61a(1) have expired, or when conditions in Article 61a(2) apply. The correction must be submitted via an information application hosted on the official website of the relevant finance ministry’s office. The correction must include: (1) location and reasons for correction; (2) taxpayer identification data (name, address, VAT ID, and country code, with intermediary-specific identifiers where applicable); (3) tax period and VAT amount subject to correction; (4) details for overpayment settlement if applicable; and (5) contact information for taxpayer and intermediary. Article 138g(6) and (7) apply to the amounts subject to correction. The corrected VAT amount must be paid in euros to the Łódź Tax Office’s bank account.
