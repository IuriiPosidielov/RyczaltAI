Polish VAT Law — Invoice Data Requirements (Article 106o)

The competent minister for public finance may, by regulation, specify cases in which invoices may contain a narrower scope of data than that required under Article 106e, and define the extent of such data, taking into account:  
1) the need to ensure adequate documentation of goods delivery or service provision and identification of activities performed by certain categories of taxpayers;  
2) low transaction value or the nature of certain business activities, linked to the number or type of activities performed.
