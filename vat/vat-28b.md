Taxation Law – Determination of Place of Service Provision (Poland)

Article 28b.1: The place of service provision for services rendered to a taxpayer is the taxpayer’s business establishment location, subject to exceptions in paragraphs 2–4 and articles 28e, 28f (paragraphs 1 and 1a), 28g (paragraph 1), 28i, 28j (paragraphs 1 and 2), and 28n.

Article 28b.2: If services are provided to a taxpayer’s fixed place of business located elsewhere than their main business establishment, the place of service provision is that fixed business location.

Article 28b.3: If the taxpayer receiving the service lacks a business establishment or fixed business location as defined in paragraph 2, the place of service provision is their fixed residence or habitual place of stay.

Article 28b.4: For services intended solely for personal or employees’ personal use—including former employees, partners, shareholders, co-owners, members of cooperatives and their household members, members of corporate governing bodies, or members of associations—the rules of Article 28c apply.

Place of service determination under Polish VAT law follows taxpayer’s business location, fixed business site, residence, or habitual residence, depending on circumstances, with specific exceptions for personal-use services governed by Article 28c.
