Tax Exemption for Investment Gold Transactions – EU Internal Trade and Import

This article provides a tax exemption for the delivery, intra-EU acquisition, and import of investment gold, including gold represented by assigned or unassigned certificates, gold traded on gold accounts, and specific financial instruments such as gold loans and gold swap transactions — provided these transactions involve ownership or claims to investment gold. It also covers futures and forward contracts resulting in ownership or claims to investment gold. The exemption extends to services rendered by agents acting on behalf of others in facilitating the delivery of investment gold for their clients.

Tax exemption applies to investment gold transactions, including but not limited to: delivery, intra-EU acquisition, import; gold certificates (assigned/unassigned); gold account transactions; gold loans; gold swaps; futures and forward contracts resulting in ownership or claims to investment gold; and services by agents acting on behalf of clients in such transactions — all governed under investment gold tax provisions within the EU legal framework.
