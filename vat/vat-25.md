EU VAT Law – Intracommunity Acquisition Rules

Intracommunity acquisition of goods is deemed to occur on the territory of the Member State where the goods are located at the time the dispatch or transport is completed.

Notwithstanding the above, where the acquirer referred to in Article 9(2) has provided, in connection with the intracommunity acquisition, a transaction number assigned by a Member State other than the one where the goods are located at the time the dispatch or transport is completed, the acquisition shall also be deemed to occur on the territory of that other Member State, unless the acquirer proves that the acquisition:  
(1) was taxed in the Member State where the goods were located at the time the dispatch or transport was completed, or  
(2) was regarded as taxed in that Member State due to the application of the simplified procedure for tripartite intracommunity transactions under Chapter XII.

— Intracommunity VAT acquisition rules define territorial attribution based on goods’ location at delivery completion, with exceptions for acquirers using foreign transaction numbers, subject to proof of taxation in the goods’ location state.
