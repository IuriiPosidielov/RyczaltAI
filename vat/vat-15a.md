VAT Group Regulations – Poland (Article 15a)

This article establishes the legal framework for VAT groups in Poland, defining eligibility, formation conditions, member obligations, and procedural requirements for group registration and maintenance. It outlines that a VAT group may consist of affiliated entities linked financially, economically, and organizationally, bound by a written agreement. Eligible members must either have a registered office in Poland or operate through a branch located within the country. Affiliation is determined by ownership (over 50% capital or voting rights), economic interdependence (shared or complementary activities), or organizational unity (common management or coordinated operations). These affiliations must be continuous during the group’s existence. Each member may belong to only one VAT group, and the group itself cannot be part of another. The group agreement must specify the group’s name, member identification data, capital amounts, designated representative, shareholder details, and a minimum 3-year duration. The group acquires legal status from the date of registration, not earlier than the date of registration under Article 96(4). The representative acts on behalf of the group and must report any changes affecting group eligibility within 14 days. The group loses its status either upon breach of conditions or upon expiration of its term.
