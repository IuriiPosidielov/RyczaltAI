**Customs Import Tax Declaration Obligations under Centralized Customs Procedures — EU Customs Code**

In cases where a taxpayer referred to in Art. 17(1)(1) and (2) utilizes a centralized customs clearance procedure (as defined in Art. 179 of the EU Customs Code), involving customs administrations of at least two Member States, the taxpayer is required to calculate and declare the import VAT amount in the import goods declaration (“import declaration”).

The import declaration must be submitted to the head of the customs and tax office within 16 days of the month following the month in which the import VAT liability arose, but no later than before filing the tax return. If goods are to be presented or made available for inspection at only one customs and tax office, the taxpayer may submit a consolidated import declaration covering a monthly period.

The taxpayer must pay the VAT amounts declared in import declarations within the deadline specified in paragraph 2, subject to Art. 33a.

For centralized customs procedures under paragraph 1, the provisions of Art. 33(2a), (3), (6), and (7) apply accordingly.

The Minister of Finance shall, by regulation, specify the format of the import declaration, including instructions for completion, submission procedures, and the jurisdictional authority of the customs and tax office head referenced in paragraph 1, taking into account: (1) the scope of duties of the customs and tax office head; (2) the nature of centralized customs clearance; and (3) the need to ensure proper VAT reconciliation control.
