Taxation of Tourism Services – Polish VAT Law (Art. 119)

This article establishes the basis for VAT calculation on tourism services, defined as the margin (revenue minus direct costs) minus the VAT due on those costs, with exceptions outlined in Art. 119(5). The margin includes services directly benefiting the tourist — such as transport, accommodation, food, and insurance — acquired from other VAT taxpayers. The rules apply regardless of the customer’s identity, provided the taxpayer acts on their own behalf and incurs costs for direct tourist benefit. Taxpayers must maintain records (Art. 109(3)) and retain documentation of such costs. No VAT deduction is permitted for VAT paid on those inputs. If the taxpayer also provides “own services” alongside purchased services, separate VAT bases apply — for own services, Art. 29a applies. The taxpayer must document the proportion of services purchased versus own services. Tourism services are taxed at 0% if all purchased services are rendered outside the EU. If services are rendered both inside and outside the EU, 0% VAT applies only to the portion outside the EU — provided supporting documents prove the foreign provision.
