Polish VAT Law – Invoice Issuance Deadlines (Article 106i)

This article establishes the legal deadlines for issuing VAT invoices in Poland, covering general rules, exceptions for advance payments, specific service/product delivery scenarios, and special provisions for returns, packaging, and contractual arrangements. It defines minimum and maximum timeframes for invoice issuance based on the nature of the transaction and contractual terms, while also addressing circumstances where a customer requests an invoice after the standard period.

Key provisions include:
- Standard deadline: invoice must be issued no later than the 15th of the month following delivery or service provision (Art. 106i ust. 1).
- Advance payment scenarios: invoice due by the 15th of the following month after receipt of payment (Art. 106i ust. 2).
- Special cases under Art. 19a (e.g., services, goods, or activities) with deadlines of 30, 60, or 90 days post-delivery/service, or upon payment (Art. 106i ust. 3).
- Extended 120-day deadline for goods with return provisions (Art. 106i ust. 4).
- Packaging return rules (Art. 106i ust. 5).
- Customer-requested invoice timing (Art. 106i ust. 6).
- Minimum 60-day advance restriction before invoice issuance (Art. 106i ust. 7), with exceptions for specific service types (Art. 106i ust. 8).
- Exemptions for certain transactions under Art. 8a (Art. 106i ust. 9).

Polish VAT law mandates specific invoice issuance timelines based on transaction type, payment timing, and contractual conditions, with exceptions for certain services and returns — relevant to VAT compliance, commercial invoicing, and cross-border trade in Poland.
