Tax Administration Law — Central Cash Register Repository System

The Head of the National Tax Administration leads the Central Cash Register Repository, issues commands to cash registers, and serves as administrator of data stored therein. The Central Cash Register Repository is a teleinformatics system designed to: (1) receive and store data from cash registers, including sales data recorded in the register’s inventory (as defined in Art. 111(1)) and operational events logged in the cash register’s memory—such as fiscalization status, tax rate changes, address updates, and technical inspection dates; (2) analyze and monitor cash register data; and (3) transmit operational commands to cash registers. Cash registers connect to the Central Cash Register Repository via telecommunications networks, ensuring: (1) direct, continuous, automated, or on-demand transmission of data from cash registers to the Repository in electronic format conforming to the logical structure specified in Art. 193a(2) of the Tax Ordinance; and (2) transmission of operational commands to cash registers, including those related to fiscalization, data transmission protocols, operational modes, and ensuring correct cash register operation. The Head of the National Tax Administration may provide data from the Central Cash Register Repository to the Minister of Finance, directors of tax administration offices, heads of tax offices, and heads of customs-tax offices, insofar as necessary for performing statutory duties.
