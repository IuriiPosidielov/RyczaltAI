VAT Intracommunity Reporting Obligations for EU VAT Registered Taxpayers — Poland

EU VAT-registered taxpayers, as defined in Article 15, are required to submit consolidated reports to the tax office concerning intracommunity transactions, including:

- Intracommunity supplies of goods (under Art. 13, para. 1 and 3, applicable under Art. 42, para. 1) to VAT-registered taxpayers or legal entities not registered as VAT taxpayers, identified for VAT purposes;
- Intracommunity acquisitions of goods (under Art. 9, para. 1 or Art. 11, para. 1) from VAT-registered suppliers, identified for VAT purposes;
- Goods deliveries under Art. 136, para. 1 or 2, to VAT-registered taxpayers or non-VAT-registered legal entities, identified for VAT purposes;
- Services subject to Art. 28b, provided on the territory of another EU Member State (excluding VAT-exempt or 0% taxed transactions), where the service recipient is liable for VAT;
- Movements of goods under the call-off stock warehouse procedure (Chapter 3b, Part II), including changes to such procedures — referred to as “summary information.”

Summary reports must be submitted monthly via electronic means by the 25th of the following month, covering:

- The month in which the VAT liability arose for transactions under para. 1, points 1–4;
- The month in which goods were moved or procedural changes occurred under para. 1, point 5.

Each summary report must include:

- Name or legal name of the reporting entity and its taxpayer identification number (as issued by the tax office under Art. 97, para. 9);
- Valid and current intracommunity transaction identifiers (with two-letter VAT code) for the recipient (para. 2);
- Valid and current intracommunity transaction identifiers (with two-letter VAT code) for the supplier (para. 3);
- Total values of intracommunity acquisitions, deliveries (including deliveries under para. 3), and services rendered — broken down by counterparties (para. 4);
- Valid and current intracommunity transaction identifier for the VAT-registered supplier (with two-letter VAT code) where goods were moved under the call-off stock procedure (para. 5).

In cases involving Art. 136 transactions, the report must include a note indicating that the transaction is part of a tripartite intracommunity arrangement.

For services under para. 4, the VAT liability lies with the service recipient if the service provider does not have a business establishment or fixed establishment in the Member State where the service is rendered — unless the service provider has a fixed establishment there that does not participate in the transaction.

For determining the moment of VAT liability in service transactions (para. 4), the provisions of Art. 19a, paras. 1–3 and 8, apply accordingly.

Tax agents (Art. 18d, para. 1) submit monthly summary reports covering intracommunity goods deliveries for which they have been authorized to settle VAT.
