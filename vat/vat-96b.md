**VAT Registration Status Registry – Electronic Public Disclosure (Poland – Tax Law)**

This article establishes the legal framework for the electronic maintenance and public disclosure of a registry of VAT taxpayers and non-registered entities by the Head of the National Tax Administration. The registry includes entities either not registered or removed from the VAT register, as well as those re-registered after removal. Data is made publicly available via the Official Information Bulletin and through designated government IT systems, enabling real-time or historical (up to 5 years prior) verification of a taxpayer’s status on any given date. Information disclosed includes legal name, tax identification number, REGON, court registry number, registered address, representative and agent details, partner information, registration/deregistration dates, legal grounds for registration status, and associated bank account numbers (subject to specific conditions). Certain data (e.g., bank account details for non-VAT group members) is withheld for non-VAT entities. The registry is updated daily, and data access is also available via Central Business Registry and Business Information Point systems. Entities may request correction of non-personal data, and tax office heads may reject such requests if they would contradict factual circumstances. The Head of the National Tax Administration may remove entities from the registry after 5 years from the date of non-registration or deregistration. Disclosure of registry data does not violate tax secrecy rules.
