VAT Scope and Exceptions — Polish VAT Act Article 5

Subject to VAT are:  
1) Domestic sales of goods and taxable services rendered within the country;  
2) Export of goods;  
3) Import of goods into the country;  
4) Intra-community acquisitions of goods for payment within the country;  
5) Intra-community supply of goods.

Taxation applies regardless of whether the activities in paragraph 1 comply with formal legal requirements.

Goods also subject to VAT as specified in Article 14; paragraph 2 applies accordingly.

In cases of tax law abuse, activities listed in paragraph 1 trigger only those tax consequences that would have occurred had the abusive acts not taken place.

Tax abuse means performing activities under paragraph 1 within transactions that, despite meeting formal statutory requirements, were primarily aimed at obtaining tax benefits inconsistent with the purpose of these provisions.

Import of goods used for construction or maintenance of international bridges or common road sections between Poland and a third country is not subject to VAT if a Council decision authorizes the application of derogations under Article 2(1)(d) of Directive 2006/112/EC.

VAT scope includes domestic sales, exports, imports, intra-community transactions; tax applies regardless of compliance; abuse defined as transactions aimed at illicit tax advantages; specific exemptions apply for cross-border infrastructure projects under EU directive derogations.
