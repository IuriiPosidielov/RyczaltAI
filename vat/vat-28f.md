Taxation Law – Place of Service Provision for Transport Services (EU VAT Context)

This article defines the place of service provision for passenger and goods transport under VAT rules, distinguishing between services rendered to taxable persons and non-taxable persons. For passenger transport, the place is determined by the actual route and distance traveled. For goods transport:

To taxable persons (within EU or third countries), the place is the taxpayer’s registered business address, permanent establishment, or habitual residence/presence in the EU or third country, depending on whether transport occurs entirely outside or within the EU.
To non-taxable persons, the place is the actual location where transport occurs, adjusted for distance, except in cross-border cases (between two EU Member States), where the place is defined as the actual starting point of the transport — irrespective of distance — and the actual endpoint.

Key terms: transport services, VAT place of supply, taxable persons, non-taxable persons, EU Member States, third countries, passenger transport, goods transport, starting point, endpoint.

This legal text defines the place of supply for transport services under EU VAT rules, distinguishing between taxable and non-taxable recipients and cross-border transport scenarios.
