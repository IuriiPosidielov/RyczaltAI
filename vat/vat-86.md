**Tax Credit for Input VAT – Polish VAT Code, Article 86**

This article establishes the right of taxpayers (as defined in Article 15) to reduce their VAT liability by the amount of input VAT incurred, subject to exclusions in Articles 114, 119(4), 120(17,19), and 124. The eligible input VAT includes:

- VAT on invoices for goods/services acquired;
- Pre-payment for goods/services before acquisition;
- Import VAT based on customs documents, declarations, or decisions under Articles 33a–34;
- VAT on services rendered by the recipient (Article 17(1)(4)) or goods delivered to the buyer (Article 17(1)(5));
- Intra-community acquisitions (Articles 9, 11);
- VAT differences under Article 30c(2);
- For taxpayers under Article 16: 22% of VAT on new transport equipment, capped at the VAT amount on the invoice or customs document.

When goods/services are used for both business and non-business purposes (excluding personal use under Articles 7(2) and 8(2), or uses under Article 8(5)), taxpayers may apply a “proportion method” to allocate VAT. This method must best reflect the business use proportion and objectively represent the share of expenses attributable to business versus non-business purposes.

The proportion method may use:
- Ratio of employees engaged exclusively in business vs. total employees;
- Ratio of business-related working hours vs. total hours;
- Business turnover vs. total turnover (including non-business income, grants, subsidies);
- Business-use area vs. total area.

For new taxpayers, provisional data may be used; they must notify the tax office by the 25th of the month following the first application of the method, not later than when submitting the tax return under Article 109(3). If prior-year data are unrepresentative, this provision also applies.

The proportion is expressed as an annual percentage, rounded up to the nearest whole number. Articles 90(5), (6), (9a), (10), (10c–10g) apply accordingly. Taxpayers may opt for an alternative proportion method if the default method under Article 22 is not representative.

For real estate and land acquired for both business and personal use (under Article 8(2)), VAT is reduced proportionally to the business-use share.

VAT credit arises when goods/services are used for:
- Export or cross-border supply (excluding exemptions under Article 113b(1)) if the VAT could have been reclaimed domestically;
- Cross-border supplies under Article 43(1)(16);
- Exempt services performed abroad or involving exported goods (under Articles 28b/28l), provided documentation links the reclaimed VAT to those services.

The right to credit arises in the tax period when the VAT liability for the goods/services arises. Specific timing rules apply for:
- Invoices and customs documents (Article 10);
- Intra-community acquisitions (Article 10b(2));
- Import simplifications (Article 10d(1));
- Cash-method small taxpayers (Article 10e);
- Taxpayers under Article 16 (Article 10f).

If the credit is not claimed within the deadlines (Articles 10, 10d, 10e), it may be claimed in the next 3 (or 2 for taxpayers under Articles 99(2–3)) tax periods. If not claimed within 5 years from the date the right arose (Article 13), the taxpayer may amend the return for the period in which the right arose or within the next 3 (or 2) periods, but not later than 5 years from the year the right arose.

For intra-community acquisitions, services, or supplies where the VAT liability is the buyer’s (Article 17), the right to credit may be claimed in the tax period when the right arose, within 5 years from the end of the year in which the right arose.

For taxpayers required to adjust input VAT under Article 91(1–2), the proportion used is based on the year the right arose, regardless of when the adjustment is made.

Article 19 allows deferral of input VAT to the next tax period if no taxable activities occurred in the current period.

Article 19a–19c governs adjustments to input VAT for reduced taxable base or invoice errors under Articles 29a(13–13c) and 30a(1a). The buyer must reduce the input VAT in the tax period when the adjustment or correction is finalized or received (e.g., via e-invoicing system).

Article 22 allows the Minister of Finance to define proportion methods for specific taxpayers via regulation, based on business characteristics and economic conditions.
