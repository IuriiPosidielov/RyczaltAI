**Customs Duty Exemptions for Humanitarian and Disaster Relief Imports – Polish Law Article 63**

Customs duty exemptions apply to goods imported by:

1. State organizations, social organizations, or statutorily established entities operating in charitable or humanitarian aid activities, if the goods are intended for free distribution or allocation to victims of natural disasters or catastrophes — either directly distributed or retained in the possession of the organization for such purposes.

2. Rescue units whose goods are specifically intended for their operational needs during conducted rescue activities.

Exemptions under paragraph 1 apply exclusively to social organizations and entities whose accounting procedures enable verification of the use of exempted goods.

Exemptions do not apply to materials or equipment intended for reconstruction of areas affected by natural disasters or catastrophes.

Exempted goods may be lent, leased, rented, or transferred only for purposes specified in paragraph 1, subject to prior notification to the customs authority.

In cases of sale, transfer of ownership, lease, loan, or other disposition of exempted goods under paragraph 1, such goods become subject to customs duties at the applicable rates on the date of the disposition, based on the customs value determined by the customs authority on that day.

In such cases, the obligation to pay import duties does not arise if:

1. The goods are used for purposes that would have qualified them for exemption under paragraph 1; and  
2. The customs authority that accepted the customs declaration for the goods’ release into circulation is promptly informed of the disposition.

If exempted goods are used for purposes other than those specified in paragraph 1, they are subject to customs duties at the applicable rate on the day of use, based on the customs value determined by the customs authority on that day.

*Customs duty exemptions for humanitarian imports under Polish law, governed by Article 63, apply strictly to designated entities and purposes, require accounting controls, and trigger revaluation and re-taxation upon misuse or commercial disposition.*
