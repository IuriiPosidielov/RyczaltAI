Legal Text: Polish VAT Law – Definitions and Taxation Rules for Art, Collectibles, Antiques, and Used Goods

This article defines key terms for VAT purposes under Polish tax law, including:  
- Artworks: Original paintings, prints, sculptures, tapestries, photographs created by artists (excluding mechanical reproductions or commercial plans).  
- Collectibles: Postal stamps, numismatic items, and objects of zoological, mineralogical, or historical value.  
- Antiques: Items over 100 years old, excluding art, collectibles, or used goods.  
- Used goods: Second-hand movable property not covered under art/collectibles/antiques, excluding precious metals or stones.  
- Sales value: Total amount received by the taxpayer from the sale of goods, including subsidies, taxes, and shipping costs (excluding amounts defined in Art. 29a ust. 7).  
- Purchase value: Total amount received by the supplier from the taxpayer for goods.  
- Total sales/purchase value: Sum of individual sales/purchase values.

VAT rate of 7% applies to:  
- Import of artworks, collectibles, and antiques.  
- Delivery of artworks by the artist or their heirs.  
- Intra-community acquisitions of such goods by VAT-registered taxpayers who meet conditions for full deduction.  
- Delivery of such goods by VAT-registered taxpayers who previously imported them under 7% rate.

For used goods, artworks, collectibles, and antiques acquired for resale, VAT is calculated based on margin (sales value minus purchase value, minus VAT paid).  
If margin calculation is impractical, taxpayers may calculate it as the difference between total sales and total purchases of specific collectibles (with prior approval from the tax office).  
If total purchases exceed total sales in a period, the excess is carried forward to the next period.  
Margin calculation method must be applied consistently until the end of the period specified in Art. 13, or until the taxpayer loses the right to use it after 12 months of continuous excess.

Taxpayers may opt for margin-based taxation only if they acquire goods from:  
- Individuals or non-VAT-registered entities;  
- VAT-registered entities under specific exemption conditions (Art. 43, 113, 113a);  
- VAT-registered entities under margin-based taxation rules;  
- VAT-registered entities whose delivery was exempt under Art. 43, 113, or 113a;  
- VAT-registered entities whose delivery was taxed under Art. 98, Directive 2006/112/EC.

For deliveries from VAT-registered entities under Art. 15, the purchase value is based on the import VAT base increased by the import VAT due.  
Taxpayers must notify the tax office in writing of their chosen method (valid for 2 years).  
General VAT rules may be applied to deliveries covered under Art. 10/11, allowing deduction of VAT on such deliveries.  
Taxpayers using both margin-based and general rules must maintain separate VAT records (Art. 109 ust. 3), including purchase values for margin calculation.

Margin-based taxation does not apply to:  
- Imported artworks/collectibles/antiques;  
- Artworks acquired directly from creators or heirs;  
- Artworks acquired from non-VAT-registered entities.  
These exceptions do not apply if goods are delivered under different VAT rules.

VAT margin-based taxation does not apply to exports, which are taxed at 0%.  
These rules do not apply to new transport vehicles in intra-community deliveries.

Polish VAT law defines artworks, collectibles, antiques, and used goods for tax purposes; applies 7% VAT on imports and certain deliveries; permits margin-based taxation with specific conditions; excludes certain acquisitions from margin rules; and applies 0% VAT on exports.
