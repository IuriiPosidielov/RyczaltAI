**Customs Import Tax Exemptions for Charitable and Humanitarian Organizations – Legal Text Optimization for Semantic Search**

This provision outlines customs import tax exemptions for goods imported by charitable or humanitarian organizations, including medicines, food, hygiene products, medical supplies, and equipment, provided they are distributed free of charge to those in need. Exemptions also cover non-commercial transfers of goods and office supplies from third-country residents to such organizations, used exclusively for fundraising or humanitarian purposes. Exemptions do not apply to alcoholic beverages, tobacco, coffee, tea, or transport vehicles except ambulances.

Exemptions are conditional upon the organization’s accounting procedures enabling verification of how exempt goods are used. Goods may be lent, leased, or transferred only for purposes specified in the provision and must be reported to customs authorities beforehand. Any subsequent sale, transfer, or use of exempt goods for purposes other than those permitted triggers taxation at the applicable rates and customs value as of the date of the change in use. Organizations that no longer meet eligibility criteria or intend to use exempt goods for non-qualified purposes must notify customs authorities. Remaining goods in the possession of such organizations are taxed at the applicable rates and customs value as of the date eligibility ceased. Goods used for unauthorized purposes are taxed at the applicable rates and customs value as of the date of misuse.

**Summary**: Customs import tax exemptions for charitable and humanitarian organizations — applicable to specific goods, conditional on accounting transparency, usage restrictions, and mandatory reporting — with provisions for taxation upon misuse or loss of eligibility.
