**Tax Law — VAT Adjustment Provisions (Poland)**

This article establishes the legal framework for adjusting previously claimed VAT deductions when a taxpayer’s right to reduce VAT liability based on input tax (as per Art. 86 para. 1) was granted in a prior tax year. It mandates correction of deductions made under Art. 90 paras. 2–10a, 10c–10g, using proportionality calculations specified therein — or under regulations issued under Art. 90 paras. 11–12 — for the completed tax year. 

The taxpayer may waive correction if the difference between the proportionality factor calculated under Art. 90 paras. 2–10a or 10c–10g and that calculated for the completed tax year does not exceed 2 percentage points. 

If the proportionality factor for the completed tax year is lower than that calculated under Art. 90 paras. 2–10a or 10c–10g, the 2-point threshold applies only if the resulting tax adjustment — excluding corrections for assets with initial value ≤15,000 zł — does not exceed 10,000 zł.

For assets classified as fixed assets or intangible assets (including land and perpetual usufruct rights) that are subject to depreciation and were transferred to the buyer, adjustments must be made over 5 years (or 10 years for real estate and perpetual usufruct rights), beginning from the year of their put into use. Annual adjustments equal 1/5 (for movable assets) or 1/10 (for real estate) of the input tax incurred at acquisition or production. For assets with initial value ≤15,000 zł, adjustments follow Art. 91 para. 1, applied at the end of the year of put into use.

Adjustments for perpetual usufruct fees are excluded from the 10-year rule; those are governed by Art. 91 para. 1. Adjustments must be filed in the taxpayer’s VAT return for the first reporting period following the tax year in question — or the final return in case of cessation of business.

If, during the adjustment period, goods or services subject to adjustment are sold or taxed under Art. 14, they are deemed still used for taxable activities until the end of the adjustment period. Adjustment must then be made in one lump sum in the VAT return for the reporting period in which the sale occurred — or for the period in which the VAT liability arose under Art. 14.

If goods or services are taxed or exempted during the adjustment period, the taxpayer must assume their continued use is tied to taxable (or non-taxable/exempt) activities, respectively.

These rules apply equally whether the taxpayer previously claimed full input tax deduction or later lost that right — and vice versa — due to a change in eligibility.

For assets subject to depreciation or perpetual usufruct rights (excluding those with initial value ≤15,000 zł), adjustments under Art. 91 para. 7 must follow the same 5/10-year rules as Art. 91 para. 2, and must be made in every subsequent change of deduction eligibility within the adjustment period.

For other goods/services used in business (not covered by para. 7a), adjustments follow Art. 91 paras. 1, 2 (third sentence), and 3 — unless para. 7c applies.

Under para. 7c, if the change in deduction eligibility results from reassignment of goods/services solely to non-taxable or taxable activities, adjustment is made in the return for the reporting period in which the change occurred — but only if more than 12 months have passed since the goods/services were put into use.

For goods/services (e.g., trade goods or raw materials) acquired for use in taxable or non-taxable activities — and not yet used as intended — adjustment is made in the VAT return for each reporting period in which the change occurred.

Taxpayers who utilized VAT exemptions under Art. 43 para. 1 lit. 3, Art. 113 para. 1, or Art. 113a para. 1 may adjust remaining input tax for the remaining adjustment period in their final VAT return as a VAT taxpayer.

Adjustments under Art. 91 paras. 5–7 also apply if goods/services intended for production (under Art. 91 para. 2) are destroyed or repurposed before being put into use.

In cases of business sale or transfer of a business unit, the buyer assumes responsibility for adjustment under Art. 91 paras. 1–8.

The Finance Minister may, by regulation, establish alternative adjustment rules or exempt certain taxpayer groups — based on operational specifics, market conditions, or ensuring accurate input tax deductions.

**Retrieval Summary**: VAT adjustment rules in Poland require correction of input tax deductions when eligibility changes, governed by proportionality, time-bound annual adjustments, and specific filing requirements — with exceptions for small-value assets, perpetual usufruct, and exemptions — and may be modified by ministerial regulation.
