VAT Law – Intracommunity Supply Rules and Registration Obligations

If, within the deadline specified in Article 13i, the right to dispose of goods as owner has not been transferred to the VAT taxpayer or their substitute, and none of the circumstances outlined in Article 13k have occurred, the intracommunity supply of goods referred to in Article 13, paragraph 3, is deemed to have taken place on the day immediately following the expiry of that deadline.

If, within the deadline specified in Article 13i, the right to dispose of goods as owner has not been transferred and the goods are returned to the territory of the country, and the taxpayer referred to in Article 13h, paragraph 2, point 2, has registered the return in the recordkeeping system provided for in Article 109, paragraph 11c, the intracommunity supply of goods under Article 13, paragraph 3, is deemed not to have occurred.

Intracommunity supply timing rules under VAT law, including default date triggers and return registration effects, governed by Articles 13i–13k and 109c.
