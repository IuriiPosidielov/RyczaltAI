Tax Law – VAT Exemption for Tax-Free Goods Delivery

Under Article 129, the seller applies a 0% VAT rate for deliveries of goods subject to refund of the travel VAT, provided the following conditions are met:

1) The seller satisfies the conditions set out in Article 127(4)(1);  
2) Before the deadline for filing the tax return for the relevant tax period, the seller obtains:  
   — an electronic export confirmation under Article 128(2), or  
   — a printed electronic TAX FREE document containing the confirmation under Article 128(5);  
3) The seller possesses documents:  
   a) Specific documents, as prescribed by separate provisions, confirming the refund of the tax amount — in cases where the refund was processed via non-cash settlement;  
   b) Documents in which the traveler has personally and clearly signed to confirm receipt of the tax refund, including the date of receipt — in cases where the refund was paid in cash.

Additionally, if the taxpayer receives:  
1) A document confirming export of goods outside the European Union, or  
2) The document referred to in paragraph 1, point 3, letter b — later than the deadline in point 2, but no later than 10 months after the end of the month in which the delivery occurred — the taxpayer may adjust the VAT due for that delivery in the tax period in which the document was received.
