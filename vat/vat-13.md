Intra-community goods delivery — legal definition and conditions under VAT law (EU)

This article defines intra-community goods delivery as the export of goods from a Member State’s territory to another Member State’s territory, in the context of activities under Article 7, subject to paragraphs 2–8. It specifies eligibility criteria for recipients, including VAT-registered persons, legal entities not registered for VAT, and specific cases involving excisable goods or new means of transport. It also outlines exceptions where such movements are not considered intra-community deliveries — e.g., installations, passenger transport, exports, or temporary use — and provides conditions under which such movements may still qualify as intra-community deliveries. The article further clarifies applicability to VAT-registered persons (Article 15) and exceptions for goods subject to special VAT regimes, including those delivered via call-off stock procedures.

Intra-community delivery of goods is governed by EU VAT rules, applies to VAT-registered entities or specific non-VAT-registered entities operating in another Member State, and excludes deliveries under specific Article 83 or Article 120 provisions. The term “intra-community delivery” is central to VAT compliance in cross-border transactions within the EU.
