**International Road Passenger Transport – VAT Compliance Obligations for Drivers**

In the case of occasional international road passenger transport by buses registered in a Member State other than the country in question, performed by taxpayers having a business establishment or permanent place of business from which such services are provided into another Member State, or by taxpayers without such an establishment but possessing a permanent residence or habitual place of stay in another Member State, the driver operating the vehicle within the country’s territory during such transport shall be required to:

1) Carry a certificate confirming the taxpayer’s active VAT registration (or a copy thereof, as provided in Art. 96(14)) — where applicable, in cases where the taxpayer is required to submit a registration declaration under Art. 96(1); or

2) Carry a printed copy of the certificate referred to in Art. 134a(4) — where applicable, in cases where the taxpayer has submitted a declaration under Art. 134a(1).

This provision governs documentation obligations for drivers engaged in cross-border road passenger transport under VAT rules, specifically targeting compliance with registration or declaration requirements for taxpayers operating across EU Member States.
