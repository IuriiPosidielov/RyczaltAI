Taxation Law – Definition of Services and Exempt/Compensated Service Provision

This provision defines what constitutes a service under Article 5(1)(1) for VAT purposes, excluding goods deliveries as defined in Article 7. It includes: (1) transfer of intellectual or legal property rights regardless of legal form; (2) obligations to refrain from or tolerate certain acts/situations; (3) services mandated by public authorities or entities acting on their behalf, or by legal authority.

Compensated services also include: (1) use of business assets for personal or non-business purposes (e.g., by owner, employees, former employees, partners, shareholders, co-owners, or their family members) where the taxpayer previously had the right to deduct VAT paid on acquisition, import, or production of those assets; (2) non-commercial services provided to the taxpayer or its associates for personal use or non-business purposes.

If a taxpayer, acting in its own name but for a third party, participates in service provision, it is treated as if the taxpayer both received and provided the service.

Article 8(2)(1) does not apply to vehicle use for non-business purposes if the taxpayer previously had the right to deduct VAT on acquisition, import, or production of the vehicle or its components — unless such deduction was not available for the vehicle itself.

In cases under Articles 8(2)(1) and 8(5), “acquisition of goods” includes acceptance of goods for use under lease, rental, leasing, or similar contractual arrangements.
