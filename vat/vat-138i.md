Customs Import Tax Procedure – Small Parcel Exemption (Poland) – Legal Framework

This article establishes a simplified customs import tax regime for low-value parcels (under €150 equivalent) not subject to excise duties, delivered to individuals within Poland. The “tax liable person” (responsible party) — typically a postal operator or authorized trader — may collect and report the 22% VAT on behalf of the recipient. The responsible party must file monthly electronic declarations, maintain digital records of all shipments including tax amounts and delivery dates, and remit collected tax by the 16th of the following month. Records must be retained for 10 years and made available to customs authorities upon request. Discrepancies between declared and actual tax amounts trigger administrative decisions by the customs office, and failure to file or pay may require tax security. The mechanism applies only if no special customs procedures (e.g., under Chapter 9) apply, and the responsible party meets specific legal status requirements.
