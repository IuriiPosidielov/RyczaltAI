Tax-Free Shopping & VAT Refund Procedures in the European Union — Legal Framework

1. VAT refunds may be claimed if the traveler takes goods out of the EU territory no later than the last day of the third month following the month in which the purchase was made.

1a. VAT refunds may not be claimed by anyone other than the traveler who made the purchase.

2. The basis for claiming a VAT refund is an electronic TAX FREE document accompanied by an electronic confirmation from the customs and tax authority verifying the export of goods listed in that document.

3. The customs and tax authority confirms the export of goods under the TAX FREE system by verifying that the traveler’s data in the electronic TAX FREE document matches the data in the presented passport or other identity document. Upon request, the authority may also stamp the export confirmation on the printed version of the TAX FREE document.

5. If the traveler leaves the EU territory from the territory of another EU member state (not the country of residence), the basis for the VAT refund is the printed TAX FREE document, confirmed by the competent customs authority through which the goods were exported.

5a. For goods purchased in another EU member state’s territory, the customs and tax authority confirms the export from EU territory by stamping the document after verifying that the traveler’s data in the document matches the data in the passport or other identity document.

6. Sellers and entities referred to in Article 127(5) who process VAT refunds for travelers may charge a fee based on the refunded amount.
