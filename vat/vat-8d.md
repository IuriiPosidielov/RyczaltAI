VAT Group Reporting and Tax Surplus Handling – Polish VAT Law

Article 8d, paragraph 1: In the first tax period’s settlement, the VAT group accounts for the amount of excess tax calculated over the tax due to be carried forward to the next tax period, as determined by the last tax return filed by its members acting as taxpayers.

Paragraph 2: A VAT group must file a tax return for the tax period in which it loses its taxpayer status.

Paragraph 3: The tax surplus resulting from the return referred to in paragraph 2 is either refunded to the group’s representative or offset against the representative’s tax liability in the next tax period’s settlement. Provisions of Article 87 apply accordingly.

Paragraph 4: After losing taxpayer status, the VAT group’s representative may adjust tax settlements for tax periods in which the group was previously a taxpayer.
