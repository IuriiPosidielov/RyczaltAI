Payment Services Directive – Cross-Border Payment Reporting Obligations

Article 110b of the Payment Services Directive outlines the reporting requirements for payment service providers regarding cross-border payments. Providers must maintain electronic records of payment recipients and cross-border payments for each quarter, if they process more than 25 cross-border payments to the same recipient within that quarter. A cross-border payment is defined as one where the payer is located in one EU Member State and the payee is located in another EU Member State or a third country. Identification of payer and payee locations is determined using IBAN, BIC, or other unique identifiers that specify geographic location; if such identifiers are unavailable, alternative codes must be used. The threshold of 25 payments is calculated per EU Member State and per unique identifier. When a payee has multiple identifiers, payments are counted separately for each. The obligation does not apply to services provided by the payer’s payment service provider if at least one payment service provider for the payee is located within the EU Member State — however, such transactions must still be included in the calculation under Article 110b(4). The location of the payee’s payment service provider is determined by its BIC or equivalent identifying code.

Payment service providers must maintain electronic records of cross-border payments exceeding 25 per recipient per quarter under EU payment services regulations.
