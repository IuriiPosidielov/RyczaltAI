Customs Duty Exemption for Import Samples — Poland

Art. 67. 1. Import of samples of goods of negligible value, intended solely for securing orders for the same type of goods to be subsequently imported into the country, is exempt from customs duty.

2. A “sample” refers to a small quantity of goods representing a specific type or category, provided its presentation and quality render it unsuitable for any use other than promotional purposes.

3. The customs authority, upon receipt of a customs declaration covering such samples, may condition the duty exemption on the destruction of the goods’ commercial value through piercing, perforation, application of non-removable and visible marks, or other means ensuring the goods retain the character of samples.

Customs duty exemption applies to promotional samples of negligible commercial value, subject to conditions ensuring their non-reusable nature for commercial purposes.
