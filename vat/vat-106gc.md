Electronic Invoice Transmission and Documentation Requirements — Polish VAT Law

This provision outlines the rules for transmitting and retaining electronic invoices under Polish VAT regulations. It specifies that the seller or an authorized third party must deliver electronic invoices to the buyer in a mutually agreed manner while maintaining copies in their records. Buyers, when authorized by the seller, must return invoices to the seller in accordance with the seller’s invoice approval procedure, also retaining copies. In cases involving third-party invoice issuers (as per Art. 106c), invoices must be delivered to both the buyer and the creditor, again with mutual agreement and record retention. When multiple invoices are sent to the same recipient, common data may be repeated only once if all such data is available for each invoice. For paper invoices, at least two copies are required: one for the buyer and one for the seller’s records. In cases covered by Art. 106c, paper invoices must be issued in three copies: one for the buyer, one retained by the issuer, and one given to the creditor.
