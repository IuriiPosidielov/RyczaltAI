**Customs Duty Exemption for Import Goods Used in Technical Testing and Analysis – EU Customs Law**

This article establishes conditions under which imported goods used for research, analysis, or testing—aimed at determining composition, quality, or technical parameters—are exempt from customs duties. Exemption applies if: (1) goods are fully consumed or destroyed during testing; (2) testing is not for commercial promotion; (3) quantities match the intended purpose. Exemption also extends to goods not destroyed or consumed, provided resulting products are either: (1) destroyed or rendered worthless; (2) surrendered to the State Treasury without cost; or (3) exported from the EU territory. If resulting products enter commercial circulation, they are taxed at rates and customs values applicable on the day testing ends. If further processed into waste or scrap with customs approval, tax is calculated based on applicable rates and values at the time of creation.

Customs duty exemption for technical testing, research, and analysis of imported goods under EU customs law, contingent on destruction, non-commercial use, and alignment with testing purpose; includes provisions for post-testing product disposition and tax treatment.
