**VAT Adjustment for Unenforceable Claims — Polish Tax Law (Art. 89a)**

This provision permits a VAT taxpayer to adjust the taxable base and VAT liability for domestic sales of goods or provision of services, if the corresponding receivable is deemed unenforceable. The adjustment applies proportionally to the portion of the receivable proven unenforceable.

Unenforceability is presumed after 90 days without settlement or disposal of the receivable following the due date stated in the contract or invoice.

Adjustment under this article requires that:
- The creditor is a registered active VAT taxpayer;
- The invoice has not been more than 3 years old (measured from the end of the year it was issued);
- (Formerly deleted conditions no longer apply).

In cases where the recipient is not a registered active VAT taxpayer (excluding those under Art. 15(1)), adjustment may still be allowed if:
- The receivable is confirmed by a final court judgment and subject to enforcement proceedings;
- The receivable is registered in the national debt register; or
- The debtor is declared a consumer insolvency under separate provisions.

Adjustments may be made for tax periods in which unenforceability is presumed, provided the receivable remains uncollected or undisposed of by the creditor’s tax return filing date.

If, after filing the return with the adjustment, the receivable is later settled or disposed of, the taxpayer must increase the taxable base and VAT liability for the period in which settlement occurred — proportionally if only partially settled.

The taxpayer must report the adjustment to the appropriate tax office in the tax return where the adjustment is made.
