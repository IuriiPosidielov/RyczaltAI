   a) Goods are dispatched or transported by a VAT-registered EU taxpayer or a third party acting on their behalf, from the territory of the Member State to the territory of another Member State, for subsequent delivery and entry into a call-off stock warehouse, where the recipient (the VAT taxpayer) is entitled to treat the goods as owned by them, in accordance with a prior agreement between the parties;

   b) The sender or transporter of the goods does not have a business establishment or fixed place of business in the Member State to which the goods are being dispatched;
