VAT Tax Base – Polish VAT Act, Article 29a

This provision defines the tax base for VAT purposes, with exceptions specified in Articles 30a–30c, 32, 119, and 120(4)–(5). The tax base includes all payments received or to be received by the supplier from the buyer, service recipient, or third party, including subsidies, grants, and other similar payments directly affecting the price of supplied goods or services.

For transactions conducted in exchange for multi-purpose vouchers, full or partial payment is adjusted by subtracting the VAT associated with the delivered goods or services, or if wage data is unavailable, the monetary value on the voucher or supporting documentation is used, also reduced by the associated VAT. The tax base includes taxes, duties, fees, and similar charges (excluding VAT itself), as well as additional costs such as commissions, packaging, transport, and insurance charged by the supplier to the buyer or service recipient.

Excluded from the tax base are early payment discounts, price reductions or discounts granted at the time of sale, and refunds of documented expenses paid by the buyer or service recipient and temporarily recorded by the taxpayer for tax purposes. For immovable buildings or structures permanently attached to land, the value of the land is excluded from the tax base unless transferred in perpetuity. The tax base is reduced by granted discounts or price reductions, returned goods and packaging, pre-sale payments refunded, and refunded subsidies, grants, or similar payments.

Packaging value is excluded if the taxpayer delivers goods in returnable packaging and charges or specifies a deposit, or if the deposit is collected under a deposit system for beverage packaging. If packaging is not returned, the tax base is increased by the packaging value 1 day after the contract’s return deadline or 60 days after delivery if no deadline exists. For beverage packaging under a deposit system, the tax base is adjusted annually based on the difference between deposited and returned packaging values (including VAT), and this adjustment is reported in the tax return for the following year.

In cases of invoice corrections for reductions in tax base, adjustments are made in the tax period when the taxpayer issued a correcting invoice, documentation proving agreement with the buyer is available, and the correction aligns with records; if documentation is unavailable, adjustments are made when obtained. For structured invoices, adjustments follow specific rules depending on the issuance method, while adjustments for overpaid or incorrect VAT are made when the correction is issued or error rectified. These rules apply to exports, intra-community deliveries, sales of utilities and telecommunications, and structured invoices.

In cases where the taxpayer did not receive confirmation from the buyer, adjustments are made in the tax period when the cause for adjustment occurred.

For cases requiring correction due to changes in VAT base (increases or decreases), adjustments are made in the tax period when the cause occurred.

For export or intra-community transactions, increases in tax base are reported only in the tax return covering the period when the transactions were recorded.
