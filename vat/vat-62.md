**Tax Exemption for Imports Supporting Social Rehabilitation and Inclusion – Poland**

This article establishes tax exemptions for the import of goods specially adapted for the social, vocational, medical rehabilitation, and scientific, cultural, and skill-enhancement support of persons with disabilities. Exemptions apply when such goods are imported by non-profit organizations whose statutory purpose includes rehabilitation and scientific/cultural support for persons with disabilities, and are delivered free of charge without economic benefit to the donor.

Exemptions also extend to:
1. Spare parts, components, and specialized equipment for such goods;
2. Tools for maintenance, inspection, calibration, or repair of such goods — provided they are imported simultaneously or subsequently, with clear evidence of intended use for previously exempt goods.

Exempt goods may be loaned, leased, rented, or transferred only for purposes specified in paragraph 1, after notification to customs authorities.

If goods are sold, transferred, leased, loaned, or otherwise disposed of for purposes other than those permitting exemption, they are taxed according to rates in effect on the date of transfer, using the customs value determined by customs authorities on that date.

Exempt goods may be loaned, rented, or transferred (paid or unpaid) by eligible organizations to persons with disabilities for non-commercial purposes without tax liability.

If exempt goods are transferred for non-eligible purposes, they are taxed according to rates in effect on the date of transfer, using the customs value determined by customs authorities on that date.

Organizations ceasing to meet eligibility criteria or intending to use exempt goods for non-eligible purposes must notify customs authorities.

Goods remaining in possession of organizations no longer meeting eligibility criteria are taxed according to rates in effect on the date eligibility expired, using the customs value determined by customs authorities on that date.

Goods used by eligible organizations for purposes other than those specified in paragraph 1 are taxed according to rates in effect on the date of new use, using the customs value determined by customs authorities on that date.
