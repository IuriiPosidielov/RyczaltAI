Tax Liability Triggering Rules – Polish VAT Law (Art. 19a–12)

This article establishes the timing of VAT liability arising from supply of goods or provision of services, with specific exceptions and conditions. Liability arises upon delivery of goods or completion of service, subject to exclusions in Art. 19a ust. 1a–11, Art. 14 ust. 6, Art. 20, Art. 21 ust. 1, and Art. 138f. 1a. For cases under Art. 8a ust. 1 and 3, liability arises at the moment of transfer of a single-purpose voucher. For deliveries under Art. 7a ust. 1 and 2 to or by an assisting taxpayer, liability arises upon acceptance of payment as defined in Art. 41a of Regulation 282/2011.

Part 2 covers partial services: a service is deemed performed upon completion of a part for which payment is specified. For services with successive payment terms, liability arises per payment period until service completion. For continuous services over one year without periodic payments, liability arises annually until completion. These rules apply to goods deliveries except those under Art. 7 ust. 1 pkt 2 or Art. 7a ust. 1 and 2 involving assisting taxpayers.

Art. 19a ust. 5 defines liability triggers including: (1) receipt of payment for: a) consignment sales, b) transfers under public authority mandates or legal ownership exchange, c) enforcement deliveries (Art. 18), d) court-related services (excluding Art. 28b import services), e) exempt services (Art. 43 ust. 1 pkt 37–41); (2) receipt of subsidies or grants (Art. 29a ust. 1); (3) invoice issuance for: a) construction/montage services, b) printed books/gazettes (excluded under Art. 7a); c) printing services (excluded under Art. 28b); (4) invoice issuance for: a) energy/gas, b) telecom, leasing, security, legal, distribution services (excluding Art. 28b import services).

Art. 19a ust. 6–8 clarify that for payments under ust. 5 pkt 1 and 2, liability is tied to received amounts. For services under ust. 5 pkt 3 and 4, if no invoice is issued or issued late, liability arises upon expiry of deadlines under Art. 106i ust. 3–4; otherwise, upon payment due date. If prepayment or advance is received before delivery/service, liability arises upon receipt, except for deliveries under Art. 19a ust. 1b or services under ust. 5 pkt 4.

Art. 19a ust. 9–11 define import liability: arises at time of customs debt creation, except for active customs procedures (Art. 324 of Regulation 2015/2447), or when customs charges are due (e.g., storage, transit, free customs zones). Art. 19a ust. 12 allows the Minister of Finance to set later liability dates via regulation, considering sector-specific conditions and EU law.

VAT liability triggers in Poland are defined by delivery/service timing, payment receipt, invoice issuance, and import procedures — with exceptions for specific transactions, public authority transfers, and EU-aligned customs rules.
