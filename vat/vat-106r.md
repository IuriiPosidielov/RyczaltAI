Tax Law – Electronic Invoicing System (e-Faktur) Regulation (Poland)

This text outlines amendments to Article 106r and the addition of Article 106s of the Polish tax code, governing the operation of the National e-Invoicing System (Krajowy System e-Faktur). The provisions, effective from February 1, 2026, define the scope of permissions to use the system, methods of granting or revoking access, authentication procedures including certificate-based identity verification, standardized invoice data requirements, marking mechanisms for structured invoices, verification protocols for invoices issued outside the system, and technical standards for invoice transmission with attachments. Additional provisions cover application procedures for issuing or ceasing to issue invoices with attachments, administrative processes for granting or withdrawing such permissions, and technical requirements for ensuring authenticity, integrity, and verifiability of invoice data. Article 106s grants the Minister of Finance authority to define exceptions to the mandatory use of structured invoices, considering industry-specific needs, documentation feasibility, technical capabilities, and anti-fraud measures.
