Employment Tax Law – Article 160: Transition Rules for Tax Reporting Methods and Legal Status of Legal Entities’ Branches (Poland)

Legal entities’ branches (as defined in Art. 157(2)(2)) that, under the law specified in Art. 175, had chosen cash-based accounting or quarterly reporting lose the right to use these methods, starting with the April 2004 tax period.

For the April 2004 tax period, branches mentioned in Art. 157(2)(2) must file their tax returns at the tax office headed by the competent head of the local tax authority.

From May 1, 2004, a legal entity whose branches previously operated as separate taxpayers assumes all rights and obligations previously held by those branches—specifically those related to VAT—in the extent they pertain to VAT.

Transition of tax reporting methods and legal status for branches of legal entities under Polish VAT law, effective April 2004, including mandatory filing at local tax offices and consolidation of VAT obligations.
