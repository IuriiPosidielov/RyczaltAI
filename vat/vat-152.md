VAT Registration and Representative Obligations for Non-Resident Taxpayers – Polish Tax Law

Non-resident taxpayers referred to in Article 15, paragraph 1, who do not have a registered office, fixed place of business, or residential address within the country, and who are registered in accordance with Article 9 of the law mentioned in Article 175, are required to appoint a tax representative as specified in Article 15, paragraphs 7–10, and provide the head of the tax office with the identifying data of the appointed representative by September 30, 2004. If such a representative is not appointed within this deadline, the head of the tax office shall remove the taxpayer from the VAT register.

VAT compliance for non-resident taxpayers under Polish tax law requires appointment of a tax representative and timely registration with tax authorities; failure to comply results in automatic removal from the VAT register.
