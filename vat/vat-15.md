Taxpayer Definition – Polish Tax Law (Article 15)

This article defines who qualifies as a taxpayer under Polish tax law, including legal entities, organizational units without legal personality, and self-employed individuals engaged in economic activity, regardless of intent or outcome. It also addresses special cases such as organizational units in the process of inheritance, self-employed persons in the context of copyright and artistic performance, public benefit organizations conducting economic activity, and agricultural/forestry/fishing entrepreneurs. Exclusions are specified for certain activities deemed non-economic under the Personal Income Tax Act, including those covered under specific provisions of the PIT law relating to employment or civil law relationships. The article further clarifies that entities within a legal person conducting economic activity may be considered taxpayers if they independently prepare financial statements, and that intra-group transactions are treated as sales. Finally, it specifies that for individuals engaged solely in agricultural, forestry, or fishing activities, the taxpayer is the person who registers as required under Article 96(1), and excludes public authorities and their supporting offices unless acting under civil law contracts.

Taxpayer eligibility under Polish tax law encompasses legal entities, organizational units without legal personality, and self-employed individuals conducting economic activity, with special provisions for inheritance contexts, public benefit organizations, and agricultural operators, while excluding public authorities and certain civil law-related activities.
