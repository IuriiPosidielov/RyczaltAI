VAT Evidencing Obligations – Polish VAT Law (Art. 109 et seq.)

This text outlines the legal requirements for VAT-registered taxpayers in Poland to maintain accurate and timely sales, purchase, and transaction records, including electronic documentation, submission deadlines, and penalties for non-compliance. It applies to various taxpayer categories, including those with exempt sales, service providers, and entities involved in cross-border or intra-community transactions. The provisions cover record-keeping formats, data elements required (e.g., transaction type, tax base, customer details, documentation), submission methods (electronic transmission), correction procedures, and administrative penalties for errors or omissions. Special rules govern specific sectors, such as tourism (TAX FREE system), call-off stock procedures, and packaging return systems. The Ministry of Finance retains authority to define data formats, submission templates, and exemptions through regulations.
