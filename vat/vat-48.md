**Customs Duty Exemptions for Personal Imports Related to Marriage Migration – Polish Tax Law**

This provision establishes customs duty exemptions for personal goods imported by individuals relocating from a third country to the domestic territory due to marriage, provided they resided in the third country for at least 12 months prior. Exemptions also extend to wedding gifts sent by third-country residents, subject to value limits (max 1,000 EUR equivalent). Exclusions apply to alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. To qualify, goods must be pre-declared within 4 months of marriage, with proof of marriage submitted. Pre-marriage declarations are permitted if accompanied by a deposit securing future tax liability. For 12 months post-declaration, goods may not be pledged, sold, rented, used, leased, or otherwise disposed of without prior customs notification. Any such disposition prior to the 12-month period triggers taxation at the rate applicable on the date of disposition, based on the customs value determined by the customs authority.

Customs duty exemptions for personal imports tied to marriage relocation, gift imports, exclusions for alcohol/tobacco, pre-declaration requirements, deposit provisions, and post-declaration usage restrictions under Polish customs law.
