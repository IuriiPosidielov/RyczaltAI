Tax Law – Polish VAT Registration Notification Procedure

The supplier or service provider and the buyer or service recipient must notify the head of the tax office prior to performing the first action referred to in Article 145e(1) of the VAT Act. The notification must include: (1) the notifier’s details — name or full name and tax identification number; (2) the date the actions commence; and (3) a description of the type of actions being performed. If any of the above details change, the notifier must submit an updated notification within 14 days of the change, including the date the change occurred.

This provision governs pre-transaction notification requirements under Polish VAT law for taxable persons engaging in cross-border or domestic supply activities.
