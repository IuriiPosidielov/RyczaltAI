VAT Declaration Obligations for EU-Identified Taxpayers — EU VAT Directive Implementation

Taxpayers identified for EU procedures are required to submit VAT declarations electronically to the competent tax office, regardless of whether intra-EU goods deliveries or services under the EU procedure occurred. Declarations are due quarterly, by the end of the month following each quarter. If the deadline falls on a Saturday or a legally designated public holiday, the deadline is extended to the next working day. Each VAT declaration must include: taxpayer identification number; for each consumption country, total net transaction values (excluding VAT) and corresponding VAT amounts broken down by VAT rates; and total VAT due. In cases involving cross-border shipments from non-identifying member states, additional data must be provided for each country of origin, including net transaction values, VAT amounts by rate, and taxpayer identification numbers (or equivalent) of the originating country’s taxpayer. If the taxpayer has multiple fixed establishments in different member states, the declaration must also include total service values broken down by consumption country and identification numbers for each relevant establishment. Corrections to erroneous VAT declarations may be filed in the current reporting period, no later than 3 years from the deadline for the original declaration, and must specify the correct consumption country, reporting period, and VAT amount affected. All amounts in declarations are expressed in euros. If payments are made in currencies other than euros, they are converted using the ECB’s published exchange rate for the last day of the reporting period, or the next day’s rate if none is published. VAT payments in euros must be made to the competent tax office’s bank account within the same deadline, with the relevant VAT declaration referenced.
