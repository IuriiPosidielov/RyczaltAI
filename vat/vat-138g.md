VAT Declaration Obligations for Import Distance Sales – Polish Tax Code (Art. 138g)

This provision establishes the electronic submission requirements, content, deadlines, and currency rules for VAT declarations related to distance sales of imported goods under Polish VAT law. It applies to taxpayers, including those represented by intermediaries, and mandates monthly declarations submitted via electronic means to the competent tax office. Deadlines are extended to the last day of the following month, with exceptions for weekends or statutory holidays. Declarations must include VAT identification numbers (including intermediary IDs where applicable), country-specific breakdowns of sales values and VAT amounts, applicable tax rates, and total VAT due. Corrections for errors must be made within the current reporting period or within three years of the original deadline, with clear references to the corrected country, period, and VAT amount. All amounts must be denominated in euros, with foreign currency payments converted using ECB exchange rates published on the last day of the reporting period (or next day if no rate is available). VAT payments must be made in euros within the same deadline, referencing the relevant VAT declaration and deposited into the competent tax office’s bank account.
