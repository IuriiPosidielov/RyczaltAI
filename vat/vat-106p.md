Tax Law — VAT Regulation — Foreign Currency Valuation Methods

The competent minister for public finance may, by regulation, establish, for certain types of goods or services, an alternative method of converting foreign currency amounts shown on invoices into the national currency, for the purpose of determining the tax base, taking into account the specific characteristics of settling payments for such deliveries or services.

This provision allows for tailored currency conversion rules under VAT law, applicable to specific goods or services, and respects the particularities of international transactions in tax calculation.
