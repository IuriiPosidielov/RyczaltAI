**Customs and Tax Obligations: Payment Deadlines and Interest Penalties for Import Duties**

The taxpayer is obligated to pay the tax amount specified in decisions of the Chief of the Customs and Tax Office under Articles 33(2)–(3) and 34, within 10 days from the date of receipt of such decisions.

In cases where import duties are determined under Articles 33(2)–(3) and 34, the competent tax office head may charge interest on unpaid tax amounts, calculated according to the rates and rules applicable to late tax debt penalties, excluding provisions of paragraphs 1aa and 1ab. Interest accrues from the day after the tax obligation arises until the day the tax amount is notified.

   b) pays the unpaid tax amount (including interest) within 10 days of notification.
2) 150% of the statutory late payment interest rate (Article 56(1) of the Tax Ordinance), if a customs or closing settlement audit reveals underpayment exceeding 25% of the due amount and higher than five times the minimum wage (as defined in the Act of October 10, 2002, on Minimum Wage, Dz.U. 2024 poz. 1773), effective on the day following the payment deadline.
