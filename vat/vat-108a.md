VAT Payment Splitting Mechanism – Polish Tax Law (Art. 108a)

This provision establishes the legal framework for split payment of VAT in Poland, requiring taxpayers to separate payment of VAT from the net value of goods/services when certain thresholds or conditions are met. It applies to transactions documented by invoices exceeding 15,000 PLN or its foreign currency equivalent, and to payments governed by specific statutory provisions (e.g., Art. 106e, Art. 19a). The mechanism mandates that VAT be paid to the VAT account while the net amount is paid to a bank or cooperative savings and credit institution. Payments must be made via designated transfer messages including VAT amount, net amount, invoice number, and taxpayer identifier. Special provisions apply to multi-invoice payments within a 30-day period, and to payments involving customs representatives or public-private partnership entities. Solidary liability may arise if payments are made to incorrect recipients, but is waived if payments are corrected promptly or made directly to the correct VAT account. Violations may incur a 30% penalty, unless the supplier has fully remitted the VAT.
