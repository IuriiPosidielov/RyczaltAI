**Customs Law – Personal Effects Import Exemption (Article 47)**

This provision establishes conditions under which individuals relocating from a third country to the domestic territory may be exempt from import duties on personal effects. Eligibility requires that: (1) items were used personally in the third country (non-consumable goods must have been used for at least 6 months prior to relocation); (2) items will continue to serve the same personal purpose domestically; (3) the individual resided continuously in the third country for at least 12 months before relocation; and (4) items must not be transferred, sold, leased, or otherwise disposed of without prior customs notification within 12 months of registration for customs clearance.

Exemptions do not apply to alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, commercial transport vehicles, or professional tools (except portable applied art or exempted items).

Import of personal effects is exempt if registered for customs clearance within 12 months of relocation, subject to the 12-month restriction on disposal without prior notification.

If items are sold, transferred, leased, or otherwise disposed of before the 12-month period, they are taxed at rates applicable on the date of disposition, based on the customs value determined on that day.

Exemption also applies to personal property imported by individuals who committed to relocating within 6 months of submitting a customs declaration, provided they provide security to cover potential tax liability.

In cases where residence in the third country was less than 12 months but at least 6 months, exemption applies if the individual demonstrates they had no control over the shortened stay.

If the 12-month registration deadline is missed, exemption still applies if the individual can prove the failure was not due to their fault.
