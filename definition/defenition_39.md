Article 2 of the Polish VAT Act defines key terms used in the Act. Specifically, Article 2(27b) defines “market value” as the total amount that, for the purpose of obtaining the goods or services at a given moment, the buyer or service recipient, at the same sales stage as the one at which the delivery of goods or provision of services is made, would have to pay an independent supplier or service provider in the territory of the country under conditions of fair competition. In cases where comparable deliveries of goods or provision of services cannot be determined by value, market value shall be determined as follows: for goods, an amount not less than the purchase price of the goods or similar goods, and in the absence of a purchase price, the production cost determined at the time of delivery; for services, an amount not less than the total cost incurred by the taxpayer for the provision of those services.
