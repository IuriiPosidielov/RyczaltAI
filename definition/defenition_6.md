Article 2 of the Polish VAT Act defines key terms used in the Act. Specifically, Article 2(14) defines “first occupation” as the act of putting into use, for the first time, a building, structure, or part thereof, either for the benefit of the first purchaser or user or for own use, following either its construction or its improvement, provided that the expenses incurred for the improvement—under income tax regulations—amounted to at least 30% of the initial value.
