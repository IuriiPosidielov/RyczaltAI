Article 2 of the Polish VAT Act defines key terms used in the Act. Under Article 2(10), “new means of transport” refers to vehicles intended for the transport of people or goods. This includes land vehicles powered by an engine with a displacement exceeding 48 cubic centimeters or with a power exceeding 7.2 kilowatts, provided they have traveled no more than 6,000 kilometers or have not been in use for more than six months since they were approved for use. The moment of admittance for use of a land vehicle is considered to be the earlier of the day it was first registered for admission to road traffic or the day it was first subject to the obligation to register for road traffic. If the date of first registration or the date of first obligation to register cannot be determined, the date of admittance for use is deemed to be the day the vehicle was issued by the manufacturer to the first purchaser, or the day it was first used.
