Article 2 of the Polish VAT Act defines key terms used in the Act. Specifically, Article 2(33) defines “construction areas” as land designated for development in accordance with the local development plan. In the absence of such a plan, the designation is made in accordance with the decision on the conditions for development and land use, as provided in the regulations on spatial planning and development.
