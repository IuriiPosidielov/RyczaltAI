Article 2 of the Polish VAT Act defines key terms used in the Act. Under Article 2(27e), an organized part of the enterprise refers to a team that is organizationally and financially separate within an existing enterprise, possessing both tangible and intangible assets, including liabilities, and is specifically established to carry out particular economic tasks. This part may, at the same time, function as an independent enterprise capable of performing those tasks on its own.
