Article 2 of the Polish VAT Act defines key terms used in the Act. Under Article 2(8), the export of goods means the delivery of goods shipped or transported from the territory of the country to outside the territory of the European Union, either by the supplier or on their behalf, or by a buyer located outside the territory of the country or on their behalf. This definition excludes goods exported by the buyer themselves for the purposes of equipping or supplying recreational and tourist ships, aircraft, or other means of transport used for private purposes. The export of goods outside the European Union must be confirmed by the competent customs authority as specified in the customs regulations.
